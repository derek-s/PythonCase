0:00:59,375-->0:01:04,675
1978年，我去了欧洲，
第一次代表巴西

3
0:01:04,825-->0:01:07,750
  参加世界卡丁锦标赛

4
0:01:11,900-->0:01:15,100
只是单纯的开车和比赛

5
0:01:15,518-->0:01:18,050
没有政治因素

6
0:01:18,363-->0:01:23,363
也与金钱无关，只是单纯而真实的比赛

7
0:01:31,125-->0:01:33,775
我们并没有想到

8
0:01:34,114-->0:01:36,925
卡丁车可以成为一种职业

9
0:01:37,363-->0:01:40,700
但是，它已成为我们生活的一部分

10
0:01:40,850-->0:01:43,750
 我们都有点担心

11
0:01:44,030-->0:01:47,100
因为来到了F1

12
0:01:47,487-->0:01:50,075
愿上帝永远保护他

13
0:01:50,320-->0:01:53,000
危险的速度，这是我最担心的事

14
0:01:53,375-->0:01:56,375
我要感谢他，他是一个好儿子

15
0:01:56,600-->0:02:00,725
今年他一直很努力，诚实

16
0:02:00,933-->0:02:04,750
对我来说，这比任何头衔都重要

17
0:02:10,475-->0:02:13,525
很少有人真正了解我

18
0:02:13,525-->0:02:19,725
他们不明白当赛车手的代价

19
0:02:20,019-->0:02:24,200
我要离开朋友和家人数千英里远

20
0:02:24,200-->0:02:26,150
住在欧洲

21
0:02:26,150-->0:02:29,758
这么年轻，一直处于竞争中

22
0:02:29,758-->0:02:31,988
这一切都来之不易 

23
0:02:36,805-->0:02:38,525
重要时刻来了

24
0:02:38,882-->0:02:42,775
艾尔顿准备第一次驾驶F1赛车

25
0:02:42,900-->0:02:46,875
我相信这是上帝给我的机会

26
0:02:48,475-->0:02:51,250
我已经等了很久了

27
0:02:51,713-->0:02:55,325
而她也帮助我冷静，这很好

0:03:09,600-->0:03:14,460
我就是喜欢人与机械浑然一体的感觉
I always like the combination of a man and a machine.

30
0:03:14,460-->0:03:19,240
我想这大概就是赛车运动的精华所在
I think that's the real special quality that motor-racing in general

31
0:03:19,240-->0:03:21,930
特别是F1
and, in particular Formula One.

32
0:03:21,930-->0:03:25,090
人们总说  车况决定一切  不是吗
People say: "Oh, it's all about the car, isn't it?"

33
0:03:25,090-->0:03:26,400
其实不是这样
Well, actually it's not,

34
0:03:26,400-->0:03:30,200
赛车因素可能占50%  或稍多一点
but the car is certainly 50%, probably a bit more.

35
0:03:30,200-->0:03:33,950
即便有75%到80%
And... even if it's 75% or 80%,

36
0:03:33,950-->0:03:37,630
其他20%则取决于车手
the other 20%, which is represented by the driver,

37
0:03:37,630-->0:03:40,580
至关重要  是胜负的关键
is absolutely crucial. This is what can make a difference.

38
0:03:40,580-->0:03:44,410
而赛车本身
But the cars themselves...

39
0:03:44,530-->0:03:46,140
不管你相信与否
You either believe this or you don't.

40
0:03:46,140-->0:03:48,870
赛车本身极具美感
The cars themselves are beautiful things.

41
0:03:49,080-->0:03:54,140
车身上的香烟广告虽让美丽打些折扣
They are a little 'less when they are painted as cigarette packets

42
0:03:54,140-->0:03:56,410
我也不知道现在他们往赛车上喷些什么
or whatever they paint them now, perhaps,

43
0:03:56,410-->0:04:03,320
但整辆赛车散发着一种美
but there is a beauty to the sense of form following function,

44
0:04:03,320-->0:04:06,490
赛车的外形从某种程度上讲非常优美
that the form of the car is expressive in some way.

45
0:04:06,490-->0:04:09,690
加之它们在赛道上狂奔时的那种速度
The speed they're gonna to go at when they start moving.

46
0:04:09,830-->0:04:13,540
还有车体结构设计上的精细
And the details of the engineering

47
0:04:13,540-->0:04:17,020
即便你不是内行
even if you are not technically literate

48
0:04:18,150-->0:04:19,560
仍然会发现这种美
are very beautiful.

49
0:04:19,560-->0:04:22,750
雕塑般的那种美  可以这么讲
the beautiful bit of sculpture, if you like.

50
0:04:22,920-->0:04:29,950
这种美与冰冷机械的融合
The combination of these beautiful and inanimate machines,

51
0:04:29,950-->0:04:34,120
还有赛车手身上带有的那种英雄色彩
and the heroic figure of the drivers,

52
0:04:34,330-->0:04:39,360
勇气和浪漫主义的体现
the sense of courage and romance,

53
0:04:39,900-->0:04:41,410
这样一种特性
that kind of thing

54
0:04:42,480-->0:04:47,750
是我从小就为之着迷的原因
is what attracted me I think when I was a small boy.

55
0:04:47,750-->0:04:49,910
我认为80年代
I think formula one of the 80s' was

56
0:04:49,910-->0:04:53,180
是F1最为光辉的一段时期
one of the most glorious times in Formula One.

57
0:04:53,520-->0:04:58,220
那时的赛车与现在相比  结构简单许多
The cars were almost simple, compared to what they are now.

58
0:04:58,220-->0:05:00,700
方向盘只负责让赛车转向
the steering wheel only turn the car.

59
0:05:00,910-->0:05:03,710
换挡手柄只负责排档
A gear lever shifts the gears.

60
0:05:03,710-->0:05:07,470
那时  仍然是赛手主宰着比赛
It was a time when drivers still made the difference

61
0:05:07,470-->0:05:12,720
工程师和电子技师的权责有限
and all the engineering expertise and electronics

62
0:05:12,720-->0:05:16,060
车手发挥的余地很大
still left a great deal for the drivers to do.

63
0:05:16,060-->0:05:21,950
那时候有  "教授"阿兰·普罗斯特
You had Alain Prost, known as "The Professor"

64
0:05:21,950-->0:05:26,180
一位驾风非常细腻精确的赛车手
a very smooth, a very calculatiing driver.

65
0:05:26,180-->0:05:29,730
有巴西的尼尔森·皮盖特
You had Nelson Piquet, who was Brazilian,

66
0:05:29,730-->0:05:36,800
一位充满激情而略显狡猾的车手
a very emotional, clever and cunning driver.

67
0:05:36,800-->0:05:40,270
奈杰尔·曼赛尔  人称"英伦雄狮"
You have Nigel Mansell, who was sort of the British Lion

68
0:05:40,270-->0:05:45,670
是一位驾风剽悍  极富观赏性的赛手
who was very exciting to watch, a spectacular driver.

69
0:05:45,670-->0:05:49,230
当然还有一身正气的塞纳
And then you have Senna, the virtuous.

70
0:05:49,830-->0:05:53,910
这些车手的职业生涯
And to see these drivers competing with each other,

71
0:05:54,540-->0:05:58,110
多多少少有些重叠
more or less the same stage of their career,

72
0:05:58,110-->0:06:01,390
欣赏他们的巅峰较量
overlapping slightly in a way,

73
0:06:01,390-->0:06:06,660
简直是太棒了
but really at that peak together was phenomenal.

74
0:06:08,160-->0:06:11,780
1984年  摩纳哥

75
0:06:31,700-->0:06:33,670
埃尔顿  这是一座美丽的城市
Ayrton, this is a beautiful city,

76
0:06:33,760-->0:06:35,510
有着美丽的街道供人漫步
with wonderful streets to walk,

77
0:06:35,510-->0:06:37,430
但是否适合赛车比赛呢
but unsuitable to host a race, no?

78
0:06:39,330-->0:06:41,520
的确  我最后才赶到
Indeed. I arrived at the last minute

79
0:06:41,660-->0:06:44,560
我惊讶了  我从未到过摩纳哥
and I was surprised. I've never been to Monaco.

80
0:06:44,730-->0:06:47,430
我进行了一些试车
I did some test drive.

81
0:06:47,520-->0:06:51,910
很幸运  我适应了赛道
And fortunately, I managed to adapt to the path.

82
0:06:52,200-->0:06:54,570
这里不容任何失误
There is no margin for error:

83
0:06:54,570-->0:06:56,630
任何错误都会导致事故
any error would result in an accident.

84
0:06:56,630-->0:06:58,950
不过目前我还是很满意的
But for now, I'm satisfied.

雷吉纳尔多·列明\N巴西环球电视评论员

86
0:07:04,490-->0:07:07,670
当埃尔顿·塞纳加入托勒曼车队时
when Ayrton began to be noticed aboard a Toleman.

87
0:07:10,910-->0:07:14,320
托勒曼车队并不是有竞争力的车队
The Toleman was not a winning team.

88
0:07:14,320-->0:07:16,670
赛车性能低下
The car was bad

89
0:07:16,760-->0:07:20,070
从未赢下过一场大奖赛
and never won a race.

90
0:07:20,400-->0:07:26,370
因此埃尔顿在摩纳哥的表现堪称天才
That's why what Ayrton did in Monaco was true genius.

91
0:07:28,330-->0:07:30,320
现在很多车手都陷入一种困境
Now lots of drivers do that.

92
0:07:31,010-->0:07:32,680
加入一支小车队
Joining a small team

93
0:07:32,680-->0:07:33,880
然后就此销声匿迹了
and disappear without a trace.

94
0:07:33,880-->0:07:36,450
他们的水平被车队所限制
They perform to the level of the team.

95
0:07:37,850-->0:07:41,180
然而就有这样一类稀有的车手
But there is a rare breed of drivers,

96
0:07:41,180-->0:07:44,000
塞纳便是其中之一
Senna was absolutely one,

97
0:07:44,000-->0:07:45,950
他们能从加入一支小车队为起点
who can go in a small team

98
0:07:46,040-->0:07:50,640
打破赛车性能的限制  发挥出超凡的水平
and perform so far above the perceived level of the car.

99
0:07:51,070-->0:07:54,440
令所有人关注  不理解他是如何做到的
that everybody turns around and thinks how did he do that.

100
0:07:54,600-->0:07:57,620
他所做到的
What he had done

101
0:07:57,750-->0:07:59,590
令工作区的每一个人
make everybody in the paddock

102
0:07:59,590-->0:08:01,480
都认识到他的能力
aware of what he could do,

103
0:08:01,480-->0:08:04,070
记住他的名字  了解他的潜力
who he was and what his potential was.

104
0:08:04,070-->0:08:07,930
他开着一辆性能低下的赛车
That he could take this car which had nothing,

105
0:08:07,930-->0:08:10,320
却能跑出骄人的成绩
and deliver a result like that,

106
0:08:10,320-->0:08:13,760
而且是在最为糟糕的比赛条件下
in the worst possible conditions for a racing driver.

107
0:08:13,760-->0:08:18,010
你永远不能想象
It is impossible to overestimate

108
0:08:18,210-->0:08:21,990
在雨中赛车有多么的恐怖  有多难
how frightening it is race in the rain, how difficult it is.

109
0:08:21,990-->0:08:24,060
车手在雨中什么也看不见
Racing drivers can't see anything in the rains,

110
0:08:24,060-->0:08:27,000
尤其是跟在别的车后面时
especially if they are behind another car,

111
0:08:27,000-->0:08:30,750
硕大的轮胎卷起的层层水雾
with the big tires they have now that throw up so much spray

112
0:08:30,750-->0:08:34,080
给你的感觉就像在大雾中驾车
that is like driving in thick, thick fog.

113
0:08:34,350-->0:08:37,800
试想  在跑道上
You know, like trying to drive on the motorway

114
0:08:37,800-->0:08:39,310
大雾弥漫
in thick fog,

115
0:08:39,310-->0:08:44,630
能见度只有十几米  还要高速前进
with a 20-yard visibility at racing speed.

116
0:08:44,760-->0:08:48,660
能做到这点是非常出众的
And to be able to that really sorts out

117
0:08:48,660-->0:08:51,120
凭这一点  就可区分伟大车手跟优秀车手
the great racing drivers from the pretty good ones.

118
0:08:51,180-->0:08:52,650
1984年6月3日  摩纳哥大奖赛
塞纳的第8场F1大奖赛

119
0:08:55,910-->0:08:58,430
阿兰·普罗斯特发车很好
Alain Prost, who started well,

120
0:08:58,430-->0:09:00,000
一车当先
has got away in the lead.

121
0:09:00,000-->0:09:03,760
奈杰尔·曼赛尔  两辆法拉利分列三四

第七是曼弗雷德·温克霍克  
Seventh, Manfred Winkelhock.

125
0:09:10,060-->0:09:11,710
埃尔顿·塞纳位列第八
Eighth, Ayrton Senna.

126
0:09:13,960-->0:09:16,560
不过塞纳一路追赶
But Senna has come up throught the field.

127
0:09:16,560-->0:09:20,030
他从第十三位发车  已经追至第七
He started in thirteenth place and is now seventh.

128
0:09:24,480-->0:09:27,410
奈杰尔·曼赛尔的赛车失去了控制
Nigel Mansell loses control!

129
0:09:28,940-->0:09:34,270
埃尔顿·塞纳已超过科科·罗斯伯格升至第三
Ayrton Senna has now passed Keke Rosberg and is in third place.

130
0:09:38,010-->0:09:42,140
又超过了尼基·劳达
It also outperforms Niki Lauda!

131

埃尔顿·塞纳升到了第二位
Ayrton Senna earns second place

132
0:09:46,600-->0:09:50,080
通过赛道最危险的地段
the most dangerous part of the track!

声音来自
詹姆斯·亨特\N1976年F1年度总冠军

134
0:10:00,530-->0:10:03,330
塞纳太出类拔萃了
a truly outstanding talent.

135
0:10:03,330-->0:10:07,080
他每个单圈都要比阿兰·普罗斯特快3秒
He is catching Alain Prost something like three seconds per lap.

136
0:10:07,080-->0:10:10,350
这种表现太令人吃惊了
and that is a pretty staggering performance.

137
0:10:12,200-->0:10:14,420
普罗斯特在向裁判挥手
Prost is waving his hand to the officials.

138
0:10:14,420-->0:10:15,680
他想要终止比赛
He wants to stop the race.

139
0:10:15,680-->0:10:17,420
谁又能说他什么呢
Who can blame him?

140
0:10:17,600-->0:10:23,740
从公平公正的角度来讲
In fact, from a purist and dispassionate point of view,

141
0:10:23,740-->0:10:25,570
没必要终止比赛
there is no reason to stop the race.

142
0:10:27,370-->0:10:29,990
裁判在我身前挥动着红旗
There is an official in front of me with a red flag.

143
0:10:29,990-->0:10:31,460
他们想要终止比赛
They want to stop running.

144
0:10:31,460-->0:10:33,580
而黑白方格旗也在挥动
and the checkered flag is going out.

145
0:10:33,580-->0:10:36,230
难以置信
Incredible!

146
0:10:36,320-->0:10:40,840
普罗斯特停在了终点前  塞纳冲了过去
Prost is stopping and Senna cross the finish line before him.

147
0:10:40,940-->0:10:44,270
埃尔顿挥舞着手臂难掩激动
Ayrton raises his arms and gesturing with enthusiasm!

148
0:10:44,470-->0:10:47,430
宛如获胜一般庆祝着
Celebrated as if he won the race!

149
0:10:47,970-->0:10:50,220
如果再多跑几圈
If he had a few more laps,

150
0:10:50,220-->0:10:53,900
胜利就非他莫属
would certainly come into his head.

151
0:10:55,550-->0:10:58,450
我曾很有机会取胜
I had a serious chance of winning.

152
0:10:58,450-->0:11:01,670
但在他率先冲过终点前
But until he crossed the finish line in first position,

153
0:11:01,800-->0:11:03,430
一切都是未知的
you do not know.

154
0:11:03,430-->0:11:06,670
F1与政治和金钱密不可分
Formula One is politics, money

155
0:11:07,270-->0:11:09,970
当你并不那么重要的时候
and when you are not yet important,

156
0:11:09,970-->0:11:11,660
你要会知道怎么与这些东西打交道
must also deal with such things.

157
0:11:11,660-->0:11:14,790
当阿兰·普罗斯特  一位世界冠军
You have Alain Prost, the world champion,

158

在摩纳哥大奖赛上一路领先
out there leading the Monaco Grand Prix,

surviving all those wet corners,

0:11:20,160-->0:11:22,380
跑了这么多圈
going by many recs,

161
0:11:22,380-->0:11:25,510
渴望着在摩纳哥取得一场胜利
driving his heart out for a victory of Monaco

162
0:11:25,600-->0:11:28,720
突然斜刺里杀出一个一年级新秀
and here comes a first year Formula One driver,

163
0:11:28,720-->0:11:32,750
从巴西来的愣头青  埃尔顿·塞纳
from someplace in Brazil, Arydon Senna.

164
0:11:33,020-->0:11:36,070
这是我经历过的最湿滑的比赛之一
This was one of the wetest races I've ever been at

165
0:11:36,160-->0:11:38,390
比赛的确需要终止
and it needed to be stopped.

166
0:11:38,480-->0:11:41,630
而塞纳无法看透的是
What Senna could not get was that

167
0:11:42,920-->0:11:46,210
这是一场在法国周边地区举办的比赛  
it was in the French area,

168
0:11:46,210-->0:11:48,220
可以认为就是法国的赛事
considered an French event

169
0:11:49,000-->0:11:54,210
而国际汽联的总部又设在巴黎
with the FIA being housed in Paris

170
0:11:54,210-->0:11:56,930
又由法国人掌控着
and run by French men.

171
0:11:57,680-->0:12:02,680
他认为  一定有除去暴雨以外的因素
To him, there has to some reason besides the rain,

172
0:12:02,680-->0:12:05,760
并非他个人的问题
there was no problem to him,

173
0:12:06,250-->0:12:08,420
使他与胜利失之交臂
to where they take the victory away from him

174
0:12:08,420-->0:12:10,410
他很清楚再有三四圈
He knew in another 3 or 4 laps,

175
0:12:10,410-->0:12:11,750
他会追上普罗斯特
he would catch Prost,

176
0:12:11,750-->0:12:13,310
设法超过他
he would find a way around him

177
0:12:13,400-->0:12:15,470
从而跃至第一名
and he would be in the No.1 position.

178
0:12:19,300-->0:12:21,830
这对塞纳来说是个令人失望的结果
A tragic result for Senna. However,

179
0:12:21,830-->0:12:23,680
不过  即使今年没有拿到世界冠军
if not the world champion this year,

180
0:12:23,680-->0:12:26,670
如果他能继续职业生涯的话  毫无疑问
He undoubtedly will be the world champion in the future,

181
0:12:26,670-->0:12:28,640
将成为未来的世界冠军
if his career will continue.

182
0:12:29,330-->0:12:33,190
埃尔顿·塞纳  F1冉冉升起的新星
Ayrton Senna the new star of Formula One!

183
0:12:33,440-->0:12:35,510
在一场激烈的比赛后
Rooms for the first time on the podium

184
0:12:35,510-->0:12:39,230
首次登上F1的领奖台
in Formula One after a great race.

185
0:12:41,510-->0:12:42,820
明年有什么打算
What about next year?

186
0:12:42,820-->0:12:44,780
还会留在托勒曼车队吗
Will you stay with the Toleman team?

187
0:12:44,780-->0:12:47,350
-你是如何打算的  -我不知道
- What are your plans for now? - I do not know.

188
0:12:47,350-->0:12:50,320
现在还没有决定
It is still no decision,

189
0:12:50,320-->0:12:51,910
一切都不清楚
and nothing clear.

190
0:12:51,910-->0:12:55,570
我们还要等等看
We will have to wait more time to see what happens.

191
0:12:55,570-->0:12:56,750
不赢得胜利
You will not be satisfied

192
0:12:56,750-->0:12:59,040
你是不会罢休的对吧
until you are in a winning position, are you?

193
0:12:59,240-->0:13:03,230
我相信如果你从事赛车这类竞技运动
I believe if your are doing something like competing like motor racing,

194
0:13:03,320-->0:13:05,750
要么就出人头地  要么就江湖再见
you either do well or forget it.

195
0:13:06,400-->0:13:09,510
我记得几周后的底特律站
I remember in Detroit, a couple of weeks later,

196
0:13:09,640-->0:13:13,870
谣言已经在媒体间传开了
there were already rumours between media,

197
0:13:14,720-->0:13:17,970
据说车队经理和赞助商都与他有接触
managers and sponsors looking after him.

198
0:13:17,970-->0:13:20,730
我记得飞利浦·莫里斯公司[香烟制造商]找过他
I remember Philip Morris making a deal,

199
0:13:20,910-->0:13:23,920
他们之后签了一个合同
a personal contract with him after that.

200
0:13:26,280-->0:13:31,670
我们都知道他不会在托勒曼呆上三年
We knew that he wouldn't stay at Toleman for the three years,

201
0:13:31,760-->0:13:33,670
尽管合约签了这么长
the supposed length of the contract,

202
0:13:33,760-->0:13:37,150
因为托勒曼一直没有起色
because the Toleman team was not really improving

203
0:13:37,240-->0:13:42,030
庙小容不下大佛
and the potential of the team is just not big enough for such a talent.

204
0:13:46,280-->0:13:49,790
1985年

205
0:14:00,000-->0:14:04,470
莲花车队

206
0:14:04,950-->0:14:09,250
莲花是埃尔顿的完美选择
Lotus was a perfect team for Ayrton to move to.

207
0:14:09,520-->0:14:14,510
这个车队曾拿下多次总冠军和分站冠军
It was a team that had won Championships and won many Grand Prix

208
0:14:14,510-->0:14:17,570
他们在人力以及物力上提供全力支持
and they worked very very hard around Ayrton to give his talent

209
0:14:17,570-->0:14:21,950
使埃尔顿的天分得到充分发挥
and all the facilities he needed to win.

210
0:14:25,870-->0:14:28,940
84年  当我第一次涉足F1
When I came to Formula One in '84,

211
0:14:29,330-->0:14:30,850
我才刚起步
I was starting.

212
0:14:31,000-->0:14:33,590
我有许多要学要做
So I had so much learn and achieve that

213
0:14:33,590-->0:14:38,280
任何一个好成绩都是进步
anything, any good result was a progress

214
0:14:38,280-->0:14:40,130
对我都是动力
was a motivation.

215
0:14:40,440-->0:14:43,110
然后我去了一个更大的车队  莲花车队
Then I changed to a bigger team, to Lotus,

216
0:14:43,200-->0:14:46,260
我继续不断进步
and I still went up and up and up.

217
0:14:46,260-->0:14:47,830
现在也是一样
and I'm still doing it.

218
0:14:47,830-->0:14:50,010
即使我一时有什么问题
So even when I have some problems,

219
0:14:50,630-->0:14:53,120
我关注的都是下一站比赛
I look always to the next race.

220
0:14:53,310-->0:14:55,180
也许这一站我没有机会
Because maybe one race I have no chance,

221
0:14:55,180-->0:14:58,490
但下一站  或者下五站会对我有利
but the next one or the next five will be good.

222
0:14:58,490-->0:15:00,460
只是这一站表现不好
against one bad one.

223
0:15:00,780-->0:15:05,330
你要做的是将胜利越攒越多
So you've got to try to make the number bigger and bigger.

224
0:15:10,520-->0:15:13,890
塞纳的父母

225
0:15:14,020-->0:15:17,800
并且会为之努力
and made sure to get it.

226
0:15:18,090-->0:15:22,860
比如他在学校总是认真听讲
For example, he always paid attention in the classroom and at school,

227
0:15:22,860-->0:15:25,240
这样他回家就不用复习
so he didn't have to study at home

228
0:15:25,240-->0:15:28,630
就可以腾出更多时间去开卡丁车
and had more time to play with his go-kart.

声音来自
理查德·威廉姆斯\N卫报体育记者

230
0:15:39,510-->0:15:41,810
他的家庭很富有
His family was very comfortably off.

231
0:15:42,170-->0:15:46,970
当父母得知儿子立志成为赛车手
Once they recognised that his ambition was to be a racing driver,

232
0:15:46,970-->0:15:49,570
他们可毫无经济压力地
they had no problem

233
0:15:49,570-->0:15:51,480
支持儿子初期的卡丁车事业
backing his early efforts in go-karts.

234
0:15:55,250-->0:15:57,580
但这并不代表
But it would be a great mistake to think

235
0:15:58,010-->0:16:01,190
他的F1职业生涯就此钱途无忧
that he was able to buy his way to Formula One.

236
0:16:01,190-->0:16:03,580
塞纳自己也意识到
Senna himself realised

237
0:16:03,580-->0:16:05,750
如果你想在F1车坛
that in order to leave a serious

238
0:16:05,980-->0:16:08,050
留下深刻长久的影响
lasting impact in Formula One

239
0:16:08,050-->0:16:11,670
他必须要依靠自己的天份
he had to fight his way into it by virtue of his talent.

240
0:16:11,920-->0:16:16,190
1985年4月21日 葡萄牙大奖赛
埃尔顿在莲花的第二个分站

声音来自
雷吉纳尔多·列明\N巴西环球电视评论员

0:16:25,260-->0:16:30,720
当天气不好  赛道湿滑的时候
When the conditions were bad and the track became slippery

243
0:16:30,720-->0:16:32,680
他的展示时间就开始了
he had something else.

244
0:16:39,050-->0:16:42,910
埃尔顿·塞纳
葡萄牙大奖赛冠军

245
0:16:44,910-->0:16:47,410
他在埃斯托里尔表现惊人
The race in Estoril was incredible.

246
0:16:47,840-->0:16:51,580
只有一辆车没有被他套圈
He lapped every car but one.

247
0:16:55,600-->0:16:58,680
感觉很好  非常棒
It is wonderful! An extraordinary feeling.

248
0:16:58,680-->0:17:01,990
我很高兴
I am very happy because,

249
0:17:01,990-->0:17:03,900
这是我进入F1的第二年
in my second year in Formula One,

250
0:17:03,900-->0:17:07,540
我实现了自己第一个梦想  赢一个分站
I managed to fulfill my first dream, that is to win a Grand Prix.

251
0:17:13,610-->0:17:15,140
这种感觉很独特
It is something unique.

252
0:17:16,030-->0:17:17,660
它令人上瘾
It's like a drug.

253
0:17:17,660-->0:17:23,370
给人强烈而深刻的心灵震撼
It is something so strong and so intense.

254
0:17:23,720-->0:17:27,610
经历过一次  你就会去追寻一辈子
Once you experience it, you keep searching for it all the time.

255
0:17:32,440-->0:17:36,380
那天雨下得很大  赛道上根本无人匹敌
It was raining really hard. There was no competition, really.

256
0:17:36,380-->0:17:42,130
他甚至可以赢100次
He won that race 100 times.

257
0:17:42,130-->0:17:46,210
这场胜利都对巴西至关重要
It was a race important to Brazil for many reasons,

258
0:17:46,210-->0:17:50,000
就在那个周日
including the fact that this Sunday, Brazil,

259
0:17:50,000-->0:17:52,750
民选总统
the elected-President

260
0:17:52,750-->0:17:56,470
坦克雷多·内维斯过世了
President Tancredo Neves died.

261
0:17:56,560-->0:18:00,070
这是巴西政治的重要时刻
It was a very important political moment for Brazil,

262
0:18:00,160-->0:18:02,590
因为他是独裁时代之后
because he was the first elected president

263
0:18:02,680-->0:18:05,670
第一个民选总统
after the end of the dictatorship.

264
0:18:05,760-->0:18:09,910
他生了病  不久就倒下了
He felt ill and soon died.

265
0:18:10,000-->0:18:14,910
国家可能会因此再次陷入动乱
There was the risk that Brazil would suffer another blow

266
0:18:15,000-->0:18:17,990
这是所有人都不想看到的状况
or something like that, that nobody wanted.

267
0:18:18,080-->0:18:22,590
塞纳的胜利因此变得十分重要
Senna's win was very important in that sense,

268
0:18:22,680-->0:18:27,230
对公众对巴西人民对我们  都是一样
for the public and the Brazilian people and for us there,

269
0:18:27,320-->0:18:31,950
我们是在晚上知道这件事的
and I'm sure it is realised later in the evening

270
0:18:32,040-->0:18:35,310
我们正吃着晚餐
when we were at dinner. We went to dinner,

271
0:18:35,400-->0:18:39,350
没多久就纷纷放下叉子回到巴西
but then left the restaurant to return to Brazil.

272
0:18:39,800-->0:18:43,710
我是冈田米里  来自日本的电视台
I'm Mili Okada from Japan TV.

273
0:18:43,710-->0:18:47,930
富士台  我只是电视台工作人员  不是记者
Fuji TV. I am just a TV personality and not news reporter, so...

274
0:18:47,930-->0:18:50,490
这样啊  那我们一起拍张照片
I see. Let's make a picture together.

275
0:18:52,720-->0:18:55,020
我想许多日本女孩
I think many Japanese girls

276
0:18:55,120-->0:18:56,830
都是塞纳先生的车迷
are fans of Mr. Senna.

277
0:18:57,040-->0:19:00,000
现在我就在他身边  好紧张啊
Now I am close to him and I'm so nervous...

278
0:19:00,640-->0:19:03,360
欢迎来日本  日本见
Come and see Japan. See you in Japan.

279
0:19:03,360-->0:19:06,640
谢谢  亲一个  再见
Thank you. A little kiss. Bye-bye.

280
0:19:06,800-->0:19:07,740
再亲一个
Another kiss.

281
0:19:07,740-->0:19:09,170
他是一个很全面的车手
He was very complete.

282
0:19:09,170-->0:19:12,120
轮胎  引擎
From the tires to the engine,

283
0:19:12,120-->0:19:14,510
车的各个部件
to every single component of the car,

284
0:19:14,600-->0:19:16,150
他希望了解各个方面
he wanted to know everything.

285
0:19:16,240-->0:19:21,830
他会督促每个技师工程师都发挥到极致
He was pushing every mechanics and every engineer to the very limit,

286
0:19:21,920-->0:19:23,460
首先理解原理
to understand first of all,

287
0:19:23,670-->0:19:26,760
然后全面提升车的性能
then to improve the overall package.

288
0:19:26,910-->0:19:33,330
他为此花费了大量精力
And it took a lot of his energy,

289
0:19:33,920-->0:19:38,170
和他花在驾驶上面的时间
but he was concentrated as much on that aspect of the job

290
0:19:38,180-->0:19:39,630
一样多
as much as driving itself.

291
0:19:39,720-->0:19:44,660
他大概是第一个和工程师技师们
He was the first one maybe to stay at the circuit

292
0:19:44,760-->0:19:48,510
一起在赛道上呆到很晚的车手
until 9 or 10 o'clock with the engineers and mechanics.

293
0:19:48,600-->0:19:50,320
他不愿意直接回宾馆
He did not want to go back to the hotel

294
0:19:50,320-->0:19:53,960
或像普罗斯特那帮人一样打高尔夫
or go play golf like Prost and others.

295
0:20:05,100-->0:20:07,660
埃尔顿的风格只能用一个字概括
There's only one word to describe Ayrton style.

296
0:20:07,660-->0:20:09,940
"快"
That is: "Fast".

297
0:20:11,070-->0:20:16,310
他能将赛车发挥至设计性能之上
He would take the car beyond its design capacity.

298
0:20:16,440-->0:20:18,200
他会延迟刹车
He would break later,

299
0:20:18,200-->0:20:23,340
飞一般地入弯  把车推到极限
flying into these corners, with the car just over the edge.

300
0:20:23,340-->0:20:27,290
他驾驶着赛车在赛道上疯狂舞蹈
And somehow he would dance and dance with that car

301
0:20:27,410-->0:20:30,060
却从不出轨
to where it stays on track.

302
0:20:34,190-->0:20:37,190
声音来自
罗恩·丹尼斯\N迈凯轮车队经理

303
0:20:37,570-->0:20:40,600
他的速度与技巧都是顶尖的
what was very apparent was his pace and dedication.

304
0:20:41,200-->0:20:45,640
但同时  车手更需要有头脑
But in the end, what you're looking for is an intellect,

305
0:20:46,330-->0:20:49,420
然后我想  这小伙是可塑之材
and I thought, "This guy's got what it takes."

306
0:20:56,210-->0:20:59,150
很快他就发现
It pretty soon became apparent that

307
0:20:59,350-->0:21:01,870
在莲花车队  发展空间太小
Lotus was not big enough for him,

308
0:21:01,960-->0:21:06,550
那个车队当时刚刚开始衰落
that was actually a team just beginning its decline.

309
0:21:07,280-->0:21:08,990
而他无能为力
I think when he was there really

310
0:21:09,120-->0:21:10,920
他无法阻止这种颓势
there was nothing he could do to stop it.

311
0:21:10,920-->0:21:14,430
车手又不设计赛车
The driver does not design the car.

312
0:21:14,520-->0:21:18,560
所以  就像他之前做的
So he did what he had done,

313
0:21:18,560-->0:21:19,720
像所有伟大的车手一样
he did what great drivers do,

314
0:21:19,720-->0:21:24,510
他转会至一个更有竞争力的车队
that is to move on, to move again to a even more competitive team.

315
0:21:24,600-->0:21:27,030
对车手来说  知道自己属于哪里
It is such an important instinct for a driver that

316
0:21:27,120-->0:21:28,830
是个相当重要的直觉
to know where to be,

317
0:21:28,920-->0:21:31,220
这个赛季谁比较强不重要
to know not who is competitive this season,

318
0:21:31,320-->0:21:33,150
重要的是下赛季  谁更具竞争力
but who's gonna be competitive next season.

319
0:21:34,680-->0:21:38,030
当时比较突出的车队
At that time the stronger teams

320
0:21:38,120-->0:21:41,430
有威廉姆斯和迈凯轮
were Williams and McLaren.

321
0:21:41,520-->0:21:43,590
当时的迈凯轮
The McLaren was,

322
0:21:45,280-->0:21:48,710
我觉得和埃尔顿
I can tell, a team which has always reflected

323
0:21:49,000-->0:21:50,870
有相似的价值观
values of Ayrton.

324
0:21:50,960-->0:21:54,230
埃尔顿和罗恩·丹尼斯有很多共同点
In that sense Ayrton and Ron Dennis have much in common.

325
0:21:54,320-->0:21:57,830
他们都是完美主义者
They are both perfectionists...

326
0:21:57,960-->0:22:00,230
他们都认为
I'll use this. Both have

327
0:22:00,320-->0:22:02,410
只要事先计划好执行好
the idea that nothing will

328
0:22:02,410-->0:22:06,150
就一定不会出错
go wrong if it is well planned and executed

329
0:22:06,240-->0:22:09,630
他们都努力做到尽善尽美
and have always fought for the same ideal.

330
0:22:09,720-->0:22:12,070
罗恩是凭着奋斗
Ron comes from

331
0:22:12,160-->0:22:15,430
走到这个位置的
a reality of hard work.

332
0:22:15,560-->0:22:17,630
中间过程颇为辛苦
It is one that has struggled to get where he is now

333
0:22:17,720-->0:22:21,390
但是他成功了
and has been successful.

334
0:22:21,680-->0:22:25,300
那时他们的口号是
At that time the trilogy

335
0:22:25,400-->0:22:27,780
"最好的车队  最好的车手  最好的赛车"
"The best team, best driver, best car"

336
0:22:27,880-->0:22:31,350
这就是罗恩·丹尼斯领导下的迈凯轮
was led by Ron Dennis at McLaren.

337
0:22:35,710-->0:22:38,940
80年代中叶  迈凯轮是领头羊
In the mid-80s, McLaren were the team to beat.

338
0:22:38,940-->0:22:40,870
罗恩·丹尼斯是最佳车队经理
Ron Dennis was the best team manager.

339
0:22:41,300-->0:22:43,540
阿兰·普罗斯特是最佳车手
Alain Prost was the best rider.

340
0:22:46,640-->0:22:48,610
普罗斯特的绰号是"教授"
We all called Prost "The Professor"

341
0:22:48,610-->0:22:50,980
因为他非常有条理
because he would do, methodically,

342
0:22:50,980-->0:22:53,560
只做会让自己保持领先的事
whatever it took to be ahead on points.

343
0:22:53,780-->0:22:55,680
如果需要他跑到第五名
If it meant coming fifth,

344
0:22:55,680-->0:22:58,760
他会安安稳稳地去拿第五名的积分
he would hold the fifth place and collect those points

345
0:22:58,930-->0:23:03,140
而不会为领奖台奋斗
rather than fighting for a second, third or first place finish.

346
0:23:04,050-->0:23:07,990
而且  他极为了解赛场政治
And he certainly understood the politics of the sport,

347
0:23:07,990-->0:23:11,170
比谁都更为精通
and he played that game smarter than anyone.

348
0:23:16,220-->0:23:18,420
赛琳娜·斯科特
BBC电视台 沃冈脱口秀

349
0:23:18,420-->0:23:20,580
因为你事先计划好了一切  
because you plan everything out

350
0:23:20,580-->0:23:21,790
从不多走一步
and you know where you're going.

351
0:23:21,790-->0:23:23,210
是这样吗
Is that actually true?

352
0:23:23,210-->0:23:25,080
我很现实
I'm very realistic,

353
0:23:25,080-->0:23:28,700
有竞争力时我会放手一搏
so I think when I'm competitive, I know that I'm competitive.

354
0:23:28,700-->0:23:31,250
没有的话  还是稳健一点
When I'm not, I know I'm not so.

355
0:23:31,380-->0:23:32,910
为什么没有女性赛车手呢
Why are there no women racing drivers?

356
0:23:32,910-->0:23:37,310
我真的不知道为什么女性
I really don't know exactly why women are not very competitive

357
0:23:37,310-->0:23:39,690
在车坛  尤其是F1完全没有竞争力
in motor racing, especially in Formula One.

358
0:23:39,880-->0:23:41,970
不过你知道  你很漂亮  
But, you know, you are a beautiful woman,

359
0:23:41,970-->0:23:43,190
我知道在迈凯轮
and I know somebody at McLaren

360
0:23:43,320-->0:23:46,390
有人对你感兴趣  我可以安排的
who likes you very much, and I can arrange it.

361
0:23:47,320-->0:23:51,470
阿兰  如果有人可以教我开车
Alain, you know, if only someone would teach me how to drive a car,

362
0:23:51,560-->0:23:53,590
开赛车  我大概会考虑转行
a racing car, I might be able to give up this job and...

363
0:23:53,680-->0:23:56,830
我什么都能教
There is nothing important I could not teach you.

364
0:24:01,260-->0:24:03,140
你妻子会开车送你吗
Does your wife drive you home?

365
0:24:06,250-->0:24:08,130
我第一次认识他
The first time I really met him

366
0:24:08,130-->0:24:12,230
试着和他聊天是1984年
and tried to talk to him was in 1984,

367
0:24:12,230-->0:24:14,870
我们在德国
when we were in Germany.

368
0:24:14,870-->0:24:19,440
那是奔驰主办的活动
We were the Mercedes preeminance.

369
0:24:19,440-->0:24:21,990
在纽伯格林有一场小比赛
We had a small race at Nurburgring

370
0:24:21,990-->0:24:25,820
赛车是新型梅赛德斯119
with the new Mercedes 119.

371
0:24:25,820-->0:24:28,500
有很多车手参加
There were the older rider Formula One,

372
0:24:28,500-->0:24:30,040
现役的F1车手
not older, but some Formula One drivers

373
0:24:30,040-->0:24:32,460
和已经退役的
plus old Formula One drivers.

374
0:24:33,720-->0:24:36,900
我记得有丹尼·胡蒙  还有别人
I remember Denny Hulme and few other drivers.

375
0:24:36,900-->0:24:39,570
就是这么个比赛
There was this competition

376
0:24:39,570-->0:24:41,510
梅赛德斯的人问我
and some people from Mercedes they asked me

377
0:24:41,900-->0:24:45,220
能不能在机场等埃尔顿
if I could wait Ayrton at the airport.

378
0:24:45,220-->0:24:49,540
还有不到一刻钟就到了
It's about 10-15 minutes time difference

379
0:24:49,540-->0:24:53,850
我又有车  所以我就留下来等他
and since I had the car, so I was waiting for him to bring him.

380
0:24:53,850-->0:24:57,130
那是我们第一次交流
That was the first time we talked together

381
0:24:57,130-->0:25:01,930
车程很长  两三个小时吧
and we had a long drive, two or three hours.

382
0:25:01,930-->0:25:05,200
所以我们有时间说几句  他话不多
So we had time to talk. He didn't talk very much

383
0:25:05,200-->0:25:07,710
不过我开车的速度让他很惊讶
but he looked impressed. Yes,

384
0:25:07,800-->0:25:11,200
因为我在德国高速上开得很快
for that I was driving very fast on the motorway in Germany.

385
0:25:11,200-->0:25:13,420
他说  你开得真快
He said, "You are driving fast."

386
0:25:13,630-->0:25:17,750
我们谈得挺开心  关系也拉近了
It was nice and we were quite close.

387
0:25:17,840-->0:25:20,790
那时候他谁也不认得
Because he did not know anybody.

388
0:25:20,930-->0:25:25,900
所以第一天他总是粘在我身边
So he was always close to me during the first day.

389
0:25:26,040-->0:25:30,310
挺有趣的
It was very funny, because

390
0:25:31,320-->0:25:34,430
他那时候那么活泼可爱
he looked very open, very nice

391
0:25:34,520-->0:25:38,110
然后练习赛开始了
and then we started practice

392
0:25:38,200-->0:25:41,350
我们开始为杆位争夺
then we were fighting to each other for pole position.

393
0:25:41,680-->0:25:45,550
他是强有力的对手
And he was very...you know, very competitive.

394
0:25:45,840-->0:25:50,350
我拿到杆位  他是第二  
I was on pole, he was second and then at the start

395
0:25:51,600-->0:25:57,070
在比赛开始前  我自顾自骂了一句"妈的"
you know before the flag and I said to myself: "Shit."

396
0:25:57,480-->0:26:01,830
"我得留意这个人"
"I have to take care of...take care of the guy."

397
0:26:01,920-->0:26:02,900
那是1984年了
It was 1984.

398
0:26:03,040-->0:26:06,950
没想到我俩会成为队友
I had no idea that we would become teammates.

399
0:26:07,440-->0:26:10,670
在F1中  你的队友
In Formula One, your team-mate

400
0:26:10,760-->0:26:13,670
会是最大的对手
is your biggest rivals.

401
0:26:13,800-->0:26:16,830
就是要去击败的人
It is a person to beat

402
0:26:16,960-->0:26:20,110
因为他是唯一一个跟你车况相同的
because it is the only one who has the car equal to yours.

403
0:26:20,200-->0:26:23,740
我会说  迈凯轮的车比法拉利的好
I can say McLaren and that the Ferrari is better

404
0:26:23,840-->0:26:27,110
也可以说法拉利的车更好
or be the Ferrari with the McLaren is better, but not

405
0:26:27,200-->0:26:29,790
但不会说
that my Ferrari

406
0:26:29,880-->0:26:32,260
我的法拉利就不同于队友的
is different from that my teammate.

407
0:26:32,400-->0:26:33,710
因此
Thus,

408
0:26:33,800-->0:26:36,630
尤其是在早期赛车中
especially at early career

409
0:26:36,720-->0:26:38,950
当车手加入车队后
when a driver arrived in a team

410
0:26:39,040-->0:26:41,790
他的第一个对手就是他的队友
and its first rival is his companion.

411
0:26:41,880-->0:26:45,310
如果他比队友好
If it goes better than his fellow

412
0:26:45,400-->0:26:47,230
就有机会继续前进
has a chance to move on.

413
0:26:47,320-->0:26:49,910
如果没有  那这就是他赛车事业的终点
If not, it's the end of his career.

414
0:26:50,300-->0:26:53,550
普罗斯特已经赢得了两届世界冠军
Prost had already won two world championships.

415
0:26:53,550-->0:26:54,990
他在车队已经有好几个赛季
He had been there for several seasons.

416
0:26:54,990-->0:26:57,830
已确立了他在车队中的地位
He was extremely very established in the team.

417
0:26:57,920-->0:26:59,220
他自认为
You know he thought to himself,

418
0:26:59,220-->0:27:01,610
以他的能力  车队会把他看作
and he thought he got the team to think of him

419
0:27:01,610-->0:27:03,330
第一车手  
as the No.1 driver,

420
0:27:03,330-->0:27:04,660
领军人物
team leader,

421
0:27:04,660-->0:27:08,960
会在他身上花更多心思
the guy to whom must be very devoted,

422
0:27:09,750-->0:27:11,700
接着  塞纳加入了车队
but then Senna joint.

423
0:27:11,920-->0:27:16,830
塞纳可不接受屈居于第二的位置
And Senna was not being to... accept No.2.

424
0:27:16,920-->0:27:20,790
他可不是为了当配角才转会的
He hadn't...he hadn't joint the team to be the supporting cast.

425
0:27:23,160-->0:27:26,780
迈凯轮车队媒体发布会

426
0:27:27,440-->0:27:31,860
我们拥有世界上最优秀的两位车手
We have confident that we have the two best drivers in the world.

427
0:27:31,860-->0:27:34,400
也是两位最专业的车手
two most professional drivers as well.

428
0:27:34,520-->0:27:41,340
如果明年没有如往常一般赢得比赛
And if we not consistently win circle next year,

429
0:27:41,550-->0:27:45,390
那也肯定不是车手的问题
then we certainly won't put blame on the drivers.

430
0:27:45,720-->0:27:48,710
对我来说这是个很好的职业发展机会
It is a great opportunity for me, professional.

431
0:27:48,840-->0:27:51,760
从个人来说
And personal point of view,

432
0:27:52,390-->0:27:55,100

他非常紧张
He was very nervous.

436
0:28:07,080-->0:28:10,510
就像肩负起了全世界一样
It was as if he he bore the weight of the world on his shoulders,

437
0:28:11,080-->0:28:15,750
因为他现在需要证明
because he now had the responsibility

438
0:28:15,880-->0:28:20,230
他是一流的车手
to demonstrate he was a first rate driver.

439
0:28:21,920-->0:28:23,950
在塞纳来到迈凯轮之前
Before the Senna coming to McLaren

440
0:28:24,040-->0:28:28,550
阿兰·普罗斯特被视为团队合作的克星
Alain Prost was considered the destroyer of team-mates.

441
0:28:28,640-->0:28:31,750
我记得乔·拉米雷斯说过
I remember Jo Ramirez said,

442
0:28:33,240-->0:28:35,540
"罗纳德  我很担心
"Ronald, I am concerned

而阿兰·普罗斯特也很好强
Alain Prost has a fighter.

446
0:28:45,040-->0:28:48,230
会制造一种敌对的气氛
Create the atmosphere of a battle

447
0:28:48,320-->0:28:50,550
来教训一下新人
which helps him to destroy his opponents,

448
0:28:50,640-->0:28:53,710
1986年效力于迈凯轮
与普罗斯特关系紧张

449
0:28:53,800-->0:28:57,150
以技术来摧毁对手
Using the word "Destroy" in the technical sense.

450
0:28:57,240-->0:29:00,070
在赛道上

从精神上击败对手

452
0:29:03,080-->0:29:05,670
我对乔·拉米雷斯说

"乔  这对塞纳没用
"Jo, will be different with Senna.

454
0:29:07,760-->0:29:10,790

队上的车手

都更有天赋"

457
0:29:15,160-->0:29:17,070
事实就是这样

0:29:21,480-->0:29:26,790
极具谋略  头脑冷静
understanding of race, intelligence and cold blood,

0:29:26,880-->0:29:29,890
当他和埃尔顿比赛时  他也被震惊了
he was surprised when he began racing with Ayrton.

462
0:29:29,890-->0:29:32,910
他完全没想到
He would never have thought

463
0:29:33,040-->0:29:35,550
能有像埃尔顿这样优秀的车手
driver could be as good as Ayrton.

464
0:29:36,200-->0:29:38,710
第一的条件
F1日本大奖赛

465
0:29:38,710-->0:29:40,280
阿兰·普罗斯特

466
0:29:40,280-->0:29:42,340
埃尔顿·塞纳

467
0:29:49,080-->0:29:51,590
在埃尔顿的职业生涯中
Ayrton has, for the first time in his career,

他首次驾驶一辆足以夺冠的赛车

469

他不想失去这次机会
and he does not want to let this chance, I mean, go anywhere.

470
0:29:59,240-->0:30:01,110
那很正常  将要...  
That is normal and it is going to do...

471
0:30:01,110-->0:30:02,370
那你呢  你呢  
What about you? What about you?

但同时  观察肢体语言

在他加入F1之际  就众所周知

很难说清楚世界冠军意味着什么
It is difficult to understand what it means be a world champion.

591
0:38:43,440-->0:38:45,500
对于说自己见到上帝的人
What do you say about the man

592
0:38:45,500-->0:38:48,560
你能说什么
who says they had seen God in any circumstances,

0:38:48,680-->0:38:50,670
更别提是在大奖赛的最后一圈了
never mind the last lap of the Grand Prix,

594
0:38:50,760-->0:38:54,830
离赢得世界冠军仅一步之遥
you know, a few yards away from winning the world championship?

595
0:38:56,200-->0:38:58,390
大多数人都会质疑他的说法
Most people would be skeptical.

596
0:38:59,600-->0:39:02,270
我也不太相信
And I think most people would be right.

597

塞纳却坚决相信
Senna did seem to be absolutely convinced

598
0:39:05,480-->0:39:09,390
他见到过上帝  他没有说上帝是什么
that he'd seen God. He didn't say what God was,

599
0:39:09,560-->0:39:13,100
如何在那个时刻出现在他面前
how God appeared to him in that moment,

600
0:39:16,240-->0:39:18,700
但信仰自由是他的权利
but he's right to say that.

601
0:39:18,800-->0:39:22,500
他一定清楚这么说会冒风险
He must have known that he would risk, looking...

602
0:39:23,680-->0:39:26,990
即使不会被当作傻瓜  也肯定会遭致怀疑
not looking a fool, but attracting skepticism.

603
0:39:30,600-->0:39:32,670
他虽然说了如此疯狂的话
And who are we to...

604
0:39:33,440-->0:39:36,790
但这样一个在F1历史上
who are we to challenge that mania

605
0:39:36,790-->0:39:38,750
地位无人可及的人
when anybody likes make such a claim.

606
0:39:39,480-->0:39:44,230
我们有什么权利去批判呢
But certainly unique in the history of Grand Prix.

607
0:39:44,880-->0:39:47,180
当你谈论上帝的时候
When you talking about the God,

608
0:39:47,320-->0:39:49,270
首先声明我也相信上帝
first of all, I believe in God too,

609
0:39:49,360-->0:39:53,750
但我决不会像埃尔顿那样语出惊人
but I would never use the same words that Ayrton did.

610
0:39:54,120-->0:39:56,300
当你和其他队友
When you are in the same team doing the same business

611
0:39:56,300-->0:40:00,080
在一个队里共事
and taking risk with the driver

612
0:40:00,080-->0:40:02,050
共担风险时
with the teammates and,

613
0:40:02,960-->0:40:07,330
这种说法会让你觉得很邪乎
this kind of thing does not make you very comfortable,

614
0:40:07,470-->0:40:09,760
因为这不只是
because it is not only

615
0:40:09,760-->0:40:13,190
相不相信上帝的问题
believing in God,

616
0:40:13,360-->0:40:15,200
而是像
it's like

617
0:40:15,200-->0:40:20,110
上帝赐予了我力量
using that as a strength

618
0:40:20,640-->0:40:25,580
我永远是对的
and I've been always the right.

619
0:40:25,680-->0:40:28,990
他相信自己永远都是对的
That mean, you're thinking that he was always right.

620
0:40:29,080-->0:40:31,870
而这在赛道上
And in this case it

621
0:40:31,870-->0:40:34,670
是非常危险的
could be dangerous on the track,

622
0:40:35,080-->0:40:39,270
我总是心有不安
and that I always felt, you know, sometimes not very comfortable.

623
0:40:40,320-->0:40:43,190
没错  在F1中有很多
Yeah, there were many cynics

624
0:40:44,400-->0:40:46,510
愤世嫉俗者
in Formula One

625
0:40:49,560-->0:40:51,830
他们总是怀疑
who challenged whether this was

626
0:40:53,600-->0:40:57,990
事情是否真实可信
really, you know, with authentic and real,

627
0:41:01,360-->0:41:05,030
怀疑塞纳的感觉和价值观
on account of what he felt and what his values were.

628
0:41:06,200-->0:41:10,230
但你知道  我经常
But you know, I was at witness very often

629
0:41:12,360-->0:41:16,700
能更近距离地接触他  
in a more private environment,

630
0:41:16,700-->0:41:19,070
能感觉到他真诚的信仰
and it was most definitely sincere.

631
0:41:19,960-->0:41:22,110
我们是这么觉得的
This is how we felt.

632
0:41:22,200-->0:41:25,740
他觉得他所信仰的上帝
He felt that he was supported by...

633
0:41:30,360-->0:41:33,870
站在他一边
the God he believed in

634
0:41:33,960-->0:41:37,310
我和其他人
and why on earth would I

635
0:41:37,440-->0:41:41,350
凭什么叫他放弃信仰呢
or should anybody dissuade him from that belief?

636
0:41:41,440-->0:41:43,310
因为他
Because he

637
0:41:46,920-->0:41:51,380
他那强烈的信仰是如此虔诚
was specially committed and strong beliefs,

638
0:41:51,420-->0:41:54,600
而我觉得只要是积极的  就是好的
I think they are good thing as long as they are positive ones.

639
0:42:12,060-->0:42:15,910
薇拉·露西亚·塞西特

640
0:42:16,160-->0:42:19,550
将巴西人光辉的形象传遍世界
and gives luster Brazil's image abroad.

641
0:42:19,880-->0:42:22,030
和我们分享胜利的喜悦
Shares his victory with us.

642
0:42:22,200-->0:42:23,310
我很佩服他
I admire him very much.

643
0:42:23,480-->0:42:24,540
他无所畏惧
He is very brave.

644
0:42:24,640-->0:42:25,670
我清楚这点
I just know this.

645
0:42:25,760-->0:42:26,870
我们以他为荣
We are proud of him.

646
0:42:27,640-->0:42:30,470
他是我们仅有的几项引以为豪的国宝之一
He is one of the few things that we can still be proud of.

647
0:42:30,530-->0:42:33,330
内耶达

648
0:42:34,400-->0:42:37,590
他说  "妈  我拿到世界冠军就退役"
He said, "Mom, I will stop when I win the world title."

649
0:42:37,800-->0:42:41,030
我心里清楚  他说的不是真的
In my heart, I knew that was not true.

650
0:42:41,240-->0:42:42,380
我们现在都知道
We all know that.

651
0:42:43,280-->0:42:46,380
视频资料来自
塞纳家人

652
0:42:53,460-->0:42:56,070
在1988年大奖赛夺冠后
After the 1988 Championship, which he won the title,

653
0:42:56,070-->0:42:59,690
你明显能看到
you could clearly

654
0:42:59,690-->0:43:04,230
他变了
notice that he had changed.

655
0:43:05,600-->0:43:09,790
他成功定位了自己
He had found himself.

656
0:43:09,880-->0:43:12,070
知道自己是谁
He had discovered who he was.

657
0:43:12,160-->0:43:17,150
这是那次夺冠所带来的结果
It was found as a conclusion in that victory.

658
0:43:26,340-->0:43:28,530
圣诞节发生了很多事
At Christmas, many things happen.

659
0:43:28,530-->0:43:30,290
我们结识了新朋友
We make new friends,

660
0:43:30,290-->0:43:32,060
就像我将给大家介绍的这位
like what I'm about to introduce.

661
0:43:32,060-->0:43:35,440
他是我心目中1988年"感动巴西"的人物
He was part of my 1988.

662
0:43:35,970-->0:43:37,790
埃尔顿·塞纳
Ayrton Senna.

663
0:43:46,290-->0:43:48,010
多美妙的场面
Isn't it nice?

664
0:43:49,640-->0:43:52,400
我要问你个问题
I have a question for you.

665
0:43:52,930-->0:43:57,590
大家都很激动  但我更甚
We are all excited but I am more than anyone else,

666
0:43:57,680-->0:44:00,210
因为能埃尔顿说话就像做梦一样
because it is not easy to talk to Ayrton

667
0:44:00,210-->0:44:02,990
而他现在都成我朋友了
now who is my friend.

668
0:44:03,080-->0:44:06,190
埃尔顿  你圣诞节想要什么
Ayrton, what do you want for Christmas?

669
0:44:06,280-->0:44:08,430
什么样的圣诞礼物
As a Christmas present?

670
0:44:09,140-->0:44:12,600
我可不敢直白地说我最想要的
I can not say what I want seriously.

671
0:44:12,600-->0:44:14,120
为什么呢
Why not?

672
0:44:14,600-->0:44:15,950
绝对会被剪辑掉的
It should be censored.

673
0:44:16,150-->0:44:19,440
就说是开开心心吧
Let's say I just want to be happy.

674
0:44:19,540-->0:44:21,040
你可以悄悄告诉我
Tell me through my ear.

675
0:44:28,320-->0:44:30,020
新年快乐
Happy New Year.

676
0:44:30,760-->0:44:32,440
1990年快乐
Happy 1990.

677
0:44:32,820-->0:44:34,660
91年快乐
Good '91.

678
0:44:35,210-->0:44:36,890
92年快乐
Happy '92.

679
0:44:37,290-->0:44:39,280
93年快乐
Happy '93.

680
0:45:02,000-->0:45:05,300
1989赛季的队伍
1989 season was somewhat less harmonious

681
0:45:05,300-->0:45:08,230
没有上一赛季和谐
than the year before.

682
0:45:08,880-->0:45:11,370
两位车手都
Both drivers took on

683
0:45:11,750-->0:45:13,640
不同程度铆上了劲
different levels of aggression,

684
0:45:13,750-->0:45:15,970
尤其当他们同场竞技时
especially when racing with each other.

685
0:45:17,040-->0:45:19,830
很奇怪的是
It is curious

686
0:45:19,920-->0:45:24,190
英语中  "同队伙伴"变成了"队友"
that the term "team mate" is translated to "teammate."

687
0:45:24,280-->0:45:28,110
我经常会用"队伍中的敌人"一词
I've often used the word "Enemy team".

688
0:45:28,200-->0:45:31,310
若你同时拥有普罗斯特和埃尔顿
If you have two drivers, as in the case

689
0:45:31,400-->0:45:34,710
这样两个车手
Prost and Ayrton,

690
0:45:34,800-->0:45:37,030
做队"友"
as team-mates,

691
0:45:37,120-->0:45:40,190
队内冲突
it will inevitably arise

692
0:45:40,280-->0:45:41,710
将会不可避免
internal strife.

693
0:45:42,040-->0:45:44,710
作为一个记者并参加过
As a journalist and someone who was in

694
0:45:44,800-->0:45:47,550
电视制片会议的人
a TV production meeting,

695
0:45:47,680-->0:45:50,350
每逢周末我们都会讨论发生的大事
every weekend we talked about what's the story.

696
0:45:50,440-->0:45:52,590
我们喜欢竞争
We loved the rivalry.

697
0:45:53,000-->0:45:55,040
不论是在赛道上  
We loved it on the track in the garage

698
0:45:55,040-->0:45:58,230
车库里还是回到旅馆之后
and in the motor home afterwards.

699
0:45:58,480-->0:46:02,710
罗恩很挺埃尔顿
Ron was really behind Ayrton.

700
0:46:03,920-->0:46:07,110
这点我很快发现了
But... I understood that very quickly.

701
0:46:10,000-->0:46:13,020
但对他来说这只是生意
It is a business. For him it is business,

702
0:46:13,020-->0:46:14,860
我一直明白这个道理
and I always understood.

703
0:46:15,000-->0:46:17,460
当我和尼基在一起时
When I was with Niki,

704
0:46:18,200-->0:46:21,030
开始时  他还是平等对待
it was really, half and half, I would tell from the beginning

705
0:46:21,120-->0:46:24,270
但之后他明显地偏向我
and then suddenly went obviously behind me,

706
0:46:24,360-->0:46:26,750
因为我更有前途
because I was the new generation.

707
0:46:26,850-->0:46:31,110
而埃尔顿也一样  比我更有发展前途
And Ayrton was, when I was with him, the new generation.

708
0:46:31,420-->0:46:34,410
在迈凯轮车队
You know, throghout there,

709
0:46:34,410-->0:46:36,660
对于两个车手
peers McLaren

710
0:46:36,660-->0:46:38,690
我总是一视同仁
I always had equality.

711
0:46:40,620-->0:46:43,170
有时候为了平等
We would gather some points to

712
0:46:43,880-->0:46:45,670
我们做得非常极端
quite extreme length.

713
0:46:46,040-->0:46:47,470
例如引擎的选择
I mean the engine choice for example,

714
0:46:47,470-->0:46:49,500
一旦我们决定
once we are determined

715
0:46:50,320-->0:46:52,590
哪两个引擎将被用于比赛
which two engines we are gonna be use for the race,

716
0:46:52,680-->0:46:57,310
之后就用抓阄的方式来分配
then it would be bit for the so-called number out of a hat routine.

717
0:46:57,400-->0:47:01,430
把两个引擎的号码放在某个容器中
We put the two engine numbers in some sort of container,

718
0:47:01,520-->0:47:04,150
然后车手们来轮流抽
then the drivers would alternate.

719
0:47:05,680-->0:47:07,950
应该说
This was, probably

720
0:47:09,320-->0:47:11,110
这样是为了打消某些人的偏见
this was trying to eliminate the views that

721
0:47:11,200-->0:47:13,870
他们认为本田公司在幕后操控引擎的分配
Honda was selecting which engine went to him.

722
0:47:13,960-->0:47:15,100
会这么想的人
But it was,

723
0:47:15,200-->0:47:19,110
有点想多了  因为引擎决定不了一切
you know, a degree of paranoia, because it didn't do much.

724
0:47:19,200-->0:47:23,790
不是说一个更好的引擎或更好的配置
A slightly better engine or a slightly better set up

725
0:47:23,880-->0:47:26,790
就决定谁赢得比赛
that would determine who won the race

726
0:47:26,880-->0:47:28,350
谁获得世界冠军
and he would become world champion.

727
0:47:28,520-->0:47:30,800
每当比赛进行到同队的
When it ends with Prost versus Senna

728
0:47:30,800-->0:47:32,870
普罗斯特和塞纳角逐冠军时
in the same team,

729
0:47:32,960-->0:47:36,110
浪漫主义者会支持塞纳
you know the romantics would certainly go with Senna

730
0:47:36,200-->0:47:39,550
而实用主义者则追捧普罗斯特
and the pragmatists would go with Prost.

731
0:47:40,560-->0:47:43,790
塞纳的说法也许过于直白
And Senna could be a bit cruel about it,

732
0:47:43,920-->0:47:45,950
但事实确实如此
but there were some truth

733
0:47:46,040-->0:47:49,550
普罗斯特是个爱抱怨的人
Prost, you know, was one of those who made excuses quite a lot,

734
0:47:51,120-->0:47:53,030
而没人喜欢听到车手找借口
which you never like to hear from racing drivers.

735
0:47:53,120-->0:47:56,310
让人很不屑
You know, they just fester up.

736
0:47:56,920-->0:47:59,480
车子不够好  我今天不够快
"The car was not good enough," "I was not quick enough for the day"

737
0:48:00,640-->0:48:03,310
有时候事情就这么发生了
you know, "that's the way things go sometimes,"

738
0:48:03,440-->0:48:05,150
普罗斯特总喜欢说车子不够好
But Prost tends to go into the munition

739
0:48:05,240-->0:48:08,990
或者比赛时运气不好
where the car wasn't good enough or things was against him.

740
0:48:09,080-->0:48:11,030
尽管
You know, it was,

741
0:48:11,120-->0:48:15,410
他说的很多理由
even though every element of the explanation

742
0:48:15,410-->0:48:17,110
也许是真的
might have much truth in it,

743
0:48:17,200-->0:48:19,270
但找借口的行为很不讨喜
somehow it's unattractive.

744
0:48:19,270-->0:48:21,630
你是肯定不想听的
You don't want to hear it actually.

745
0:48:28,930-->0:48:31,430
就这样队内的矛盾开始形成
That's when the glower come of within the team.

746
0:48:32,200-->0:48:35,870
两人的工程师开始彼此保密
That's when engineers stopped sharing information.

747
0:48:36,050-->0:48:39,180
就这样两人开始相互戒备
That's when drivers stopped looking over their shoulders to see

748
0:48:39,180-->0:48:41,200
斤斤计较
who is getting what from whom.

749
0:48:43,930-->0:48:47,420
埃尔顿直来直去的个性
And Ayrton is who loved the truth,

750
0:48:47,420-->0:48:51,100
和阿兰·普罗斯特渐行渐远
wasn't as in tune as Alain Prost

751
0:48:51,260-->0:48:54,910
因为普罗斯特认为比赛和政治密不可分
who was adding another dimension: the politics of sport.

752
0:48:54,910-->0:48:56,190
塞纳  普罗斯特  普罗斯特  塞纳
Senna, Prost. Prost, Senna.

753
0:48:56,280-->0:48:58,630
开始时  他们是好朋友
At the start, they are good friends.

754
0:48:58,720-->0:48:59,940
但现在他们之间起了战争
But now war is among.

755
0:49:00,080-->0:49:01,630
对于法国车手阿兰·普罗斯特来说
For the French driver Alain Prost,

756
0:49:01,720-->0:49:04,830
他的队友没有公平对待他
his teammate is not fair to him

757
0:49:04,960-->0:49:07,870
这种不和带来的影响
and these disagreements could affect

758
0:49:07,960-->0:49:09,710
持续了一个赛季
the rest of the season.

759
0:49:12,160-->0:49:16,350
一个个大奖赛后他们间的矛盾越来越深
Grand Prix after Grand Prix they went more and more distant.

760
0:49:16,350-->0:49:18,870
埃尔顿说  这个法国人很倔
Ayrton said: "This Frenchman is tough."

761
0:49:19,240-->0:49:20,350
他想要开战
"He wants war."

762
0:49:22,180-->0:49:23,700
不久之后
Some time later,

763
0:49:23,700-->0:49:27,000
他们见面也不说话了
they started to not talk anymore.

764
0:49:34,770-->0:49:36,760
声音来自
皮埃尔·凡·弗利特\N法国TF1电视台评论员

765
0:49:36,760-->0:49:38,750
法国人让·马利·巴莱斯特
Jean-Marie Balestre,

766
0:49:38,750-->0:49:43,270
支持的是阿兰  因为他们是好朋友
would support Alain, because they were good friends.

767
0:50:01,430-->0:50:04,110
我记得塞纳错失摩纳哥的冠军那年
I remember Jean-Marie Balestre was the man in charge

768
0:50:04,200-->0:50:06,950
正是让·马利·巴莱斯特当权
when Senna was denied the chance to win the Monaco Grand Prix

769
0:50:07,040-->0:50:10,630
当时塞纳在托勒曼车队  初出茅庐
with the Toleman, when he was a novice in Formula One.

770
0:50:11,640-->0:50:16,110
巴莱斯特是个很专权的人物  喜欢冒犯人
And Balestre was a very divisive figure, very confrontational,

771
0:50:17,720-->0:50:21,550
喜欢争论  非常专横
argumentative and autocratic, very autocratic.

772
0:50:22,760-->0:50:25,100
巴莱斯特
And Balestre was in charge in the,

773
0:50:25,100-->0:50:29,190
从80年代后期
still in charge in the late 80s

774
0:50:29,280-->0:50:32,550
到90年代初期都是汽联主席
right through the beginning of '90s,

775
0:50:32,640-->0:50:35,030
当普罗斯特和塞纳在铃鹿赛道
when Prost and Senna had

776
0:50:35,040-->0:50:37,910
发生那起著名碰撞时
that famous collision at Suzuka.

777
0:50:40,000-->0:50:44,310
巴莱斯特想要处罚塞纳
and Balestre was the man who attempted to sanction,

778
0:50:44,400-->0:50:47,750
要让他停赛
suspend, or whatever, Senna,

779
0:50:47,840-->0:50:51,620
塞纳因此认为自己被区别对待
who felt that he was being discriminated against,

780
0:50:52,760-->0:50:54,550
也许确实如此吧
probably with some justification.

781
0:50:54,720-->0:50:58,230
巴莱斯特先生的房间在我的对面
Mr. Balestre had the room beside me, also on the other side,

782
0:50:58,320-->0:51:02,990
我回来时看到巴莱斯特
and I enter into the room and Balestre is there,

783
0:51:03,120-->0:51:07,980
然后我们进我房间里寒暄了一番
and we came into my room and we had a talk.

784
0:51:08,520-->0:51:12,110
别忘了
Do not forget that

785
0:51:12,200-->0:51:14,910
我和
I had a very

786
0:51:14,910-->0:51:17,320
巴莱斯特主席
intense collaboration with

787
0:51:17,400-->0:51:20,670
就赛车安全达成过强烈的共识
President Balestre for the safety.

788
0:51:21,080-->0:51:23,560
但埃尔顿
But Ayrton

789
0:51:23,560-->0:51:26,670
却一口咬定
was convinced

790
0:51:27,000-->0:51:29,440
这是个阴谋  
that it was a conspiracion

791
0:51:29,440-->0:51:32,590
事情便一发不可收拾
and the story started like this.

792
0:51:32,920-->0:51:34,790
我对此深感抱歉
And I am very sorry about that.

793
0:51:35,640-->0:51:40,100
让我们欢迎FISA主席巴莱斯特先生
I would like to welcome the President FISA, Mr. Balestre.

794
0:51:42,960-->0:51:44,720
先生们好
Please, gentlemen.

795
0:51:45,470-->0:51:48,040
世界上所有的司机
All drivers in the world

796
0:51:48,040-->0:51:50,930
都在电视上看着你们
are looking at you in the TV

797
0:51:50,930-->0:51:53,910
因为他们傻傻地
because they think, stupidly,

798
0:51:53,910-->0:51:56,470
以你们为榜样
that you are an example.

799
0:51:57,550-->0:52:00,370
这是个很大的错误  但他们就是这么想
It is a big mistaken, but they think like that.

800
0:52:02,440-->0:52:03,900
我重复一遍
I repeat.

801
0:52:04,100-->0:52:08,310
今年的大奖赛最后几站不许出事故
No danger for the end of World Championship this year.

802
0:52:09,090-->0:52:10,830
我说清楚了
State clear.

803
0:52:11,010-->0:52:12,760
现在看你们的行动
Now depends on you.

804
0:52:16,380-->0:52:19,160
后面比赛对我来说很轻松
And for me, the rest was very simple.

805
0:52:19,160-->0:52:23,520
很明显  我更快
It was very very clear that I was quicker.

806
0:52:23,520-->0:52:26,520
不管你信不信
And believe me or not,

807
0:52:26,520-->0:52:29,510
那比赛就是场玩票
but I was playing within this race.

808
0:52:29,600-->0:52:31,830
我速度非常快
I was -- I was very, very fast.

809
0:52:32,090-->0:52:34,950
我知道正常情况下他不可能完成超车
I knew that he normally could not overtake.

810
0:52:35,040-->0:52:38,430
但在日本大奖赛两三站前
But I said to Ron and Ayrton,

811
0:52:38,430-->0:52:41,260
我跟罗恩和埃尔顿说
two or three races before Suzuka

812
0:52:41,260-->0:52:43,380
因为每次埃尔顿想超越我时
because every time Ayrton tried,

813
0:52:43,380-->0:52:45,510
尤其是在起步时
especially at the start, to overtake me

814
0:52:45,640-->0:52:48,430
我都让他过去了  因为我不想出事
I opened the door, because I did not want to have the crash.

815
0:52:48,560-->0:52:49,540
我就跟他们说
I would say to them:

816
0:52:49,640-->0:52:53,870
从现在起  我绝不再让他了
"From now, I mean, no way I'll open the door any more.

817
0:52:53,960-->0:52:55,990
我们各自为战
"We're fighting as a... you know,

818
0:52:55,990-->0:52:58,030
别理会什么团队精神
don't take care about the team spirit.

819
0:52:58,120-->0:53:00,110
我是为自己而战
"I-I-I fight for myself."

820
0:53:04,570-->0:53:06,760
声音来自
约翰·比西尼亚诺\NESPN评论员

821
0:53:07,480-->0:53:10,910
塞纳必须赢得日本大奖赛
Senna has to win the Japanese Grand Prix

822
0:53:10,910-->0:53:14,100
才能让积分不会拉大到毫无希望
to keep the points battle going on to the last race.

823
0:53:15,240-->0:53:18,420
普罗斯特知道塞纳没有放弃
Prost knows that Senna does not finish.

824
0:53:18,740-->0:53:22,130
而他也不会对冠军放手
He will be the Formula 1 Champion.

825
0:53:24,120-->0:53:28,230
日本大奖赛
1989年10月22日

埃尔顿·塞纳车载摄像机

827
0:53:40,720-->0:53:42,710
普罗斯特第一  塞纳第二
Prost, first. Senna, second.

828
0:53:42,960-->0:53:44,910
普罗斯特一跃领先
Prost jumped into the lead.

829
0:53:45,000-->0:53:46,470
他的起跑更加出色
His start was better.

830
0:54:01,320-->0:54:07,300
45/53
Casino之字弯

831
0:54:18,000-->0:54:21,030
46/53
Casino之字弯

832
0:54:22,920-->0:54:25,910
塞纳的良机来啦  他发起攻击
Here is an opportunity waiting Senna. Try to pass.

833
0:54:26,000-->0:54:29,470
老天  太不可思议啦
Hell! My goodness. This is fantastic.

834
0:54:29,760-->0:54:32,270
他们相撞了  这对普罗斯特有利
Finally they clash! It goes in the favour of Prost.

835
0:54:32,800-->0:54:35,330
若比赛以此结果结束
If the race ended like that,

836
0:54:35,330-->0:54:38,430
则普罗斯特赢得总冠军
Prost won the title.

837
0:54:39,380-->0:54:41,610
但对于埃尔顿·塞纳来说
But, for Ayrton Senna

838
0:54:41,800-->0:54:44,430
绝对是个坏消息
it is not a victory instead.

839
0:54:48,360-->0:54:51,730
对于塞纳的支持者
It is difficult to-to-to many people

840
0:54:51,740-->0:54:53,990
很难让他们相信
when you are a pro of Senna,

841
0:54:53,990-->0:54:55,110
怎么说呢
say that, that's,

842
0:54:55,200-->0:54:57,710
我说"我不是故意的"  他们不会信
when you say "Ok, I did not do it on purpose."

843
0:54:57,800-->0:55:01,070
坦白讲  我不是很在意  因为
To be honest, I do not care so much, because

844
0:55:01,960-->0:55:04,170
我发誓我不是故意的
I promise I did not do it on purpose.

845
0:55:04,180-->0:55:05,910
但在这个弯角
But I did not open the door,

846
0:55:06,000-->0:55:09,830
我绝没有让着他  不然事情就另当别论
which is very, very different, especially in this corner.

847
0:55:09,920-->0:55:12,350
但如果你不是个赛车手
But if you're not a racing driver,

848
0:55:12,350-->0:55:14,780
若你不了解赛道
in this corner, knowing the tracker,

849
0:55:14,880-->0:55:16,260
不了解这个之字弯
knowing the chicane,

850
0:55:16,260-->0:55:17,870
你无从评判
you can not judge.

851
0:55:18,000-->0:55:22,390
解释这种情况是在浪费时间
It's a waste of time to try to explain the situation.

852
0:55:22,480-->0:55:23,670
我是这样认为的
It is my-my opinion.

853
0:55:23,670-->0:55:25,550
这是场赛车突发事故
It's a -- it's a racing incident,

854
0:55:25,640-->0:55:28,550
尤其是在冠军争夺赛上
especially when you're fighting for the championship.

855
0:55:28,640-->0:55:31,070
如果我想让他
Knowing that if I wanted to open the door,

856
0:55:31,160-->0:55:32,990
那我自己就过不了弯
I could not make the chicane myself.

857
0:55:33,280-->0:55:36,890
两人之间的激烈争夺
It was a little bit less than not yielding

858
0:55:36,890-->0:55:39,150
互不相让
the level of aggression

859
0:55:39,640-->0:55:43,180
虽造成了碰撞
and that caused cars to collide,

860
0:55:43,640-->0:55:47,470
但却是赛车不可或缺的元素
which was, let's say, motor racing.

861
0:55:48,960-->0:55:50,860
真正的错误
But really it was then what unfolded

862
0:55:50,860-->0:55:52,470
是之后事态的发展
which was just so wrong.

863
0:56:23,320-->0:56:24,830
南尼尼过去了
Nannini passes.

864
0:56:25,200-->0:56:28,000
南尼尼暂时领先
Nannini is now in the lead.

865
0:56:31,210-->0:56:33,050
塞纳还在维修区
Senna is still in the pits.

866
0:56:37,680-->0:56:39,010
塞纳重返赛道
Senna is back on track,

867
0:56:39,910-->0:56:41,800
但他远远落后于南尼尼
but he is far behind Nannini.

868
0:56:41,800-->0:56:43,860
要赶超几乎不可能
Catching him will be almost impossible.

869
0:56:44,040-->0:56:46,390
成败在此一举  只剩五圈了
It's all or nothing, five laps to go.

870
0:56:46,480-->0:56:48,210
如果塞纳还不放弃
It will be a suicidal race for Senna,

871
0:56:48,210-->0:56:49,950
势必要放手一搏
if he decides to try anything.

872
0:56:51,420-->0:56:53,950
普罗斯特看到埃尔顿重返赛道
Then Prost saw Ayrton return to the race

873
0:56:53,950-->0:56:57,400
立刻前往赛务办公室
and immediately went to the stewards' office.

874
0:57:02,280-->0:57:04,650
南尼尼第一  塞纳第二
Nannini, first. Senna, second.

875
0:57:04,650-->0:57:06,880
塞纳试图超越南尼尼
Senna tries to pass Nannini!

876
0:57:06,880-->0:57:09,730
塞纳领先了
Senna is in the lead.

877
0:57:10,090-->0:57:11,230
51/53
Casino连续弯

878
0:57:11,830-->0:57:14,200
巴西国旗在挥舞
Brazilian flags waving!

879
0:57:14,200-->0:57:15,620
观众一跃而起
The crowd are on their feet!

880
0:57:15,620-->0:57:16,850
埃尔顿·塞纳
Ayrton Senna.

881
0:57:16,850-->0:57:19,120
到达终点了
Checkered flag!

882
0:57:19,120-->0:57:21,140
塞纳在驾驶舱里兴奋不已
Senna celebrates in the cockpit.

883
0:57:21,140-->0:57:22,700
他拍打着头盔
He hits his helmet.

884
0:57:23,020-->0:57:27,550
来自巴西的埃尔顿·塞纳
Ayrton Senna of Brazil!

885
0:57:28,260-->0:57:32,280
他明显情绪激动
Visibly moved,

886
0:57:32,700-->0:57:36,390
他推起面盔  擦拭泪水
he raises his visor and wipes away a tear.

887
0:57:36,490-->0:57:38,080
真是场绝妙的胜利
It is a fantastic victory.

888
0:57:38,470-->0:57:42,210
以前我从未见过此种情况
I have never seen anything like it.

889
0:57:44,480-->0:57:45,870
我回到维修站
I went back to the pits.

890
0:57:45,960-->0:57:48,190
看到埃尔顿在工作人员的帮助下
And I saw Ayrton, I mean, pushed by the marshals,

891
0:57:48,190-->0:57:50,430
重新点着了引擎
and, and started again.

892
0:57:50,520-->0:57:54,670
显然  我的心情很不好
And obviously, obviously I was not that happy,

893
0:57:55,200-->0:57:58,010
然后我走进车库
And-and that's it. I went into the garage.

894
0:57:58,010-->0:58:00,830
和罗恩起了争执  很压抑
I had a depressed argument with Ron.

895
0:58:01,440-->0:58:03,110
事情就是这样
And-and that's it.

896
0:58:05,880-->0:58:07,190
是的  不是  我不是故意
Yeah. No... I didn't mean to...

897
0:58:07,280-->0:58:09,390
你是先去了指挥台还是车库
Did you go to the control tower or to the garage first?

898
0:58:09,480-->0:58:11,270
车库  或许不是
Garage. Or no.

899
0:58:11,360-->0:58:13,030
我确信你先去了塔台
I believe you went to the tower first.

900
0:58:14,080-->0:58:15,390
可能是去了塔台吧  对的
Maybe, maybe to the tower. Yeah.

901
0:58:15,480-->0:58:17,470
或许你和罗恩是在塔台起的争执
Maybe your argument with Ron was in the tower.

902
0:58:17,560-->0:58:18,610
在塔台里  不错
In the tower, yeah,

903
0:58:18,610-->0:58:22,070
因为那时罗恩已经在塔台里了
because Ron was already, was already in the tower,

904
0:58:22,160-->0:58:23,810
在那里我们争执得很激烈
and we had the strong argument there.

905
0:58:23,810-->0:58:27,210
但是...  无论如何
But it never, in no situation,

906
0:58:27,210-->0:58:28,830
在塔台里时
I was, for example, in the tower

907
0:58:28,920-->0:58:31,630
我绝没与巴莱斯特先生独处过
with Mr. Balestre, alone, for example.

908
0:58:31,720-->0:58:34,830
根本没这种事  却有许多这样的报道
It did not happen. I read that many many times.

909
0:58:34,920-->0:58:37,790
我们的确有过争执  有过...
We had an argument, and we had a...

910
0:58:37,880-->0:58:42,310
我甚至没有进过赛控中心
I even not entered into the race control centre.

911
0:58:42,640-->0:58:44,310
可能还得等二十分钟
Maybe in 20 minutes.

912
0:58:44,560-->0:58:45,910
搞毛啊
Fuck you now.

913
0:58:46,160-->0:58:47,470
来杯茶吗
Have a cup of tea?

914
0:58:48,550-->0:58:51,900
声音来自
雷吉纳尔多·列明\N巴西环球电视评论员

915
0:58:52,030-->0:58:56,230
奈杰尔  他切过了之字弯
Nigel, Nigel, missed the chicane.

916
0:58:56,320-->0:58:58,190
走的是避险车道
He went through the escape route.

917
0:58:58,280-->0:59:01,670
赛事委员会办公室

918
0:59:05,160-->0:59:06,630
随着时间的过去
As the wait was prolonged,

919
0:59:06,630-->0:59:08,140
越来越多的人担心
the more people feared

920
0:59:08,140-->0:59:10,530
决定失去公正性
that the decision was becoming political.

921
0:59:30,030-->0:59:31,500
日本大奖赛专场国际汽联组委会
Team of FIA Commissioners at the Grand Prix of Japan

922
0:59:31,500-->0:59:35,350
决议将一号赛车
is to exclude the number one car

923
0:59:35,350-->0:59:39,200
及其车手埃尔顿·塞纳的名次
and its driver, Ayrton Senna,

924
0:59:39,200-->0:59:40,930
从比赛结果中除名
from the final outcome of the race.

925
0:59:40,930-->0:59:42,490
比赛结束后
After the race,

926
0:59:42,490-->0:59:47,000
大屏幕反复重播着撞车始末
a giant screen has repeatedly shown the incident

927
0:59:47,000-->0:59:50,320
及塞纳返回赛道的整个过程
and everything that happened Senna trying to get back on track.

928
0:59:50,320-->0:59:51,990
重审这些画面之后
After reviewing these images,

929
0:59:52,190-->0:59:54,430
赛委会官方得出结论
race officials have concluded

930
0:59:54,430-->0:59:57,490
塞纳在返回赛道时
that Senna failed to use the chicane

931
0:59:57,490-->0:59:58,770
未经由连续弯
to resume racing.

932
0:59:58,770-->1:00:03,100
此举违反了国际汽联第56条赛规
Senna has infringed Article 56 of the FIA regulations.

933
1:00:03,960-->1:00:05,420
你是世界冠军吗  阿兰
You are the World Champion, Alain?

934
1:00:05,420-->1:00:06,590
似乎是的
Apparently, yes.

935
1:00:08,090-->1:00:10,920
不是百分百确定  我清楚规定
I was not 100% sure. I know the regulation.

936
1:00:10,920-->1:00:15,240
但你不知道委员们会如何解读
But you never know how it's going to be interpreted.

937
1:00:16,800-->1:00:19,890
但坦白讲  我挺高兴可以离开
But to be very honest, I am quite happy to leave,

938
1:00:19,890-->1:00:22,060
因为我觉得
because I think it's...

939
1:00:22,060-->1:00:24,220
无法再和埃尔顿做队友了
it becomes absolutely impossible to work with Ayrton.

940
1:00:25,910-->1:00:27,970
这是比赛的完美结局
And-and that's a good end of championship.

941
1:00:47,490-->1:00:48,950
现在我要
What I'd like to do now

942
1:00:49,900-->1:00:55,990
向在座的各位放映一段相关录影
is to show you some footage which I think is quite relevant

943
1:00:56,330-->1:00:57,240
赛规规定
because we're told

944
1:00:57,240-->1:01:01,580
不能使用避险车道重返比赛
you can not use the escape routes to rejoin the race.

945
1:01:01,580-->1:01:04,320
避险赛道不是用来避险的
The escape routes are not for escaping through.

946
1:01:04,940-->1:01:07,490
而是应该停下来
They are in fact for stopping in,

947
1:01:07,490-->1:01:09,540
掉头  再返回正常赛道
turning around and going out of.

948
1:01:12,180-->1:01:14,900
那年的结果是  不除名
It is important to remember no exclusions

949
1:01:15,500-->1:01:19,170
不处罚  不取消资格
no penalties, no disqualifications.

950
1:01:19,710-->1:01:21,680
这次难道就可以
And for that he is excluded

951
1:01:21,680-->1:01:23,650
把他从日本大奖赛除名吗
from the Japanese Grand Prix?

952
1:01:23,650-->1:01:25,100
赛规一致性在哪
Where is the consistency?

953
1:01:26,640-->1:01:27,990
简直是大错特错
It can't be right.

954
1:01:29,180-->1:01:32,470
这是赛车史上第一次出现
That is the first time that a team

955
1:01:32,860-->1:01:37,940
车队和自己的车手较劲的情况
as one, appeal and request against its own driver.

956
1:01:39,120-->1:01:42,940
说真心话  我的心情五味陈杂
You know, so I was in this kind of mood where, honestly,

957
1:01:43,850-->1:01:45,380
虽然我很想成为世界冠军
I wanted to be World Champion,

958
1:01:45,390-->1:01:48,060
但世事难料
but everything was possible

959
1:01:48,060-->1:01:52,500
瞅瞅自己的车队  真的挺心寒的
and looking at your own team, you know going so far.

960
1:01:55,290-->1:01:57,420
我不知道结果会怎样
Yeah, I didn't know what-what-what could happen.

961
1:01:57,420-->1:01:59,940
普罗斯特非常擅长耍政治手腕
Prost was very very political.

962
1:02:01,500-->1:02:03,690
我觉得这样说一点都不过分
I think it's probably fair to say

963
1:02:03,970-->1:02:07,410
要知道他职业生涯中加过好几个车队
that he... you know, there were several teams during his career.

964
1:02:07,410-->1:02:08,920
但我觉得他和其中任何一个
and I didn't think his relationship

965
1:02:08,920-->1:02:10,440
都不是欢乐而终
with any of them ended happily.

966
1:02:14,450-->1:02:16,690
阿兰  你说你是沿正常线路跑
Alain, you say that you took a normal racing line.

967
1:02:16,690-->1:02:19,400
但从高空看来
I would put it to you that from the aerial pictures,

968
1:02:19,410-->1:02:21,700
你进弯似乎提前了
it looks as you had turned in quite early.

969
1:02:21,700-->1:02:23,450
根本不是正常的过弯路线
It wasn't a normal line at all.

970
1:02:25,270-->1:02:28,320
我赢过39场分站和三次总冠军
I won 39 races and now three Championship.

971
1:02:28,320-->1:02:33,480
你们觉得我会故意干出这种事情吗
Do you think that I would do something like this on purpose?

972
1:02:35,250-->1:02:37,070
我已经转向拐角处
You know, I've already turned for the corner

973
1:02:37,070-->1:02:38,850
可能如你所想  我是早了那么一点
maybe a little bit earlier, if you want,

974
1:02:38,850-->1:02:40,630
但那本来就是我的弯角
but that was my corner.

975
1:02:42,640-->1:02:45,470
上诉法院决定
The Court of Appeals declares

976
1:02:45,470-->1:02:51,150
吊销塞纳的赛车执照半年
a six-month license suspension for Senna.

977
1:02:53,210-->1:02:55,340
警告不仅针对埃尔顿·塞纳
A warning not only to Ayrton Senna

978
1:02:55,450-->1:02:57,240
也针对所有赛车手
but for all the drivers,

979
1:02:58,040-->1:03:01,050
同时处罚金十万美金
and a fine of $100,000.

980
1:03:01,050-->1:03:04,660
即便你是世界最好的车手之一
While you are one of the best drivers in the world,

981
1:03:04,660-->1:03:09,670
也没有权利制造愚蠢事故
you have no right cause of stupid accidents.

982
1:03:10,180-->1:03:12,550
整件事情的处理方式
The way the whole affair has been treated

983
1:03:13,200-->1:03:18,230
就是我要对一切负全部责任
is like I have total responsibility for everything that took place there.

984
1:03:18,290-->1:03:20,830
一切都归咎于我
I was blamed for everything

985
1:03:20,830-->1:03:23,270
一切错误都应惩罚我
and I was penalised for everything.

986
1:03:23,270-->1:03:24,960
对待我就像个罪犯一样
I was treated like a criminal.

987
1:03:26,670-->1:03:28,760
这完全让我无法接受
And this is totally unacceptable.

988
1:03:28,940-->1:03:31,030
他们取消了他的冠军资格
They took the Championship away from him

989
1:03:31,040-->1:03:35,050
还吊销了一阵子他的超级驾照
and they suspended his license for a period.

990
1:03:35,930-->1:03:36,930
对我来说
To me,

991
1:03:36,930-->1:03:44,070
这是在我15年F1报道生涯中
it was the worst use of power, political power,

992
1:03:44,070-->1:03:46,670
看到过的最无耻的滥用职权行为
in my fifteen years on the Formula One circuits.

993
1:03:47,920-->1:03:49,560
埃尔顿永远都不会忘记
And Ayrton would never forget it.

994
1:03:50,830-->1:03:53,000
我知道对于普罗斯特
Alain Prost, somewhere, I know,

995
1:03:53,000-->1:03:55,170
在他内心深处  为此感到羞耻
deep down inside, was ashamed of it.

996
1:03:56,920-->1:03:59,230
实际上  赛规在不久后就修改了
And the rules actually changed later

997
1:03:59,960-->1:04:04,300
新赛规中  埃尔顿的行为是合法的
to allow what Ayrton did to become legal, because of it.

998
1:04:12,460-->1:04:16,040
那段时期  埃尔顿处于低谷状态
That was quite a profound moment for Ayrton

999
1:04:16,040-->1:04:20,780
因为巴莱斯特的行径比普罗斯特更恶劣
because Balestre had behaved even worse than Prost.

1000
1:04:20,800-->1:04:24,540
他甚至想退出F1
He even thought about giving up Formula One racing.

1001
1:04:28,500-->1:04:30,330
我让他休息了一段时间
I let him alone for a while,

1002
1:04:31,450-->1:04:34,820
慢慢劝说他
gently persuaded him

1003
1:04:35,040-->1:04:37,090
你忠诚于自己的信念
you are true to your values;

1004
1:04:38,290-->1:04:44,180
如果你坚信自己是正确的
if you believe that your values are correct values,

1005
1:04:44,180-->1:04:46,980
那么  面对这些
then walking away from

1006
1:04:46,980-->1:04:50,500
生活中的阻挠
the dark forces that you face within life

1007
1:04:50,500-->1:04:52,410
就不应该屈服逃避
just doesn't become an option.

1008
1:04:58,500-->1:05:01,510
1990年

1009
1:05:06,460-->1:05:09,540
1990赛季  他归队了  也更成熟了
In 1990 Season, he came back wiser.

1010
1:05:09,540-->1:05:11,630
赛队氛围非常和谐
The team's harmonious.

1011
1:05:11,700-->1:05:14,340
普罗斯特离开迈凯轮  去了法拉利
Prost has gone out of McLaren for Ferrari

1012
1:05:14,480-->1:05:19,200
塞纳夺冠形势一片大好
and Senna has his perfect position to compete for the title.

1013
1:05:20,250-->1:05:22,890
所有赛车手都立志超越极限
All drivers aspire towards their limits.

1014
1:05:23,210-->1:05:25,790
我的极限与普罗斯特的不同
My limit is different from that of Prost.

1015
1:05:26,310-->1:05:28,440
事实如此
This is the reality.

1016
1:05:30,170-->1:05:34,360
他不是想办法提高自己的实力
Instead of trying to improve his own capacity,

1017
1:05:34,360-->1:05:37,780
而是攻击我  他觉得那是捷径
he found it easier to attack me.

1018
1:05:37,780-->1:05:39,810
埃尔顿的思想有点问题
Ayrton has a small problem.

1019
1:05:39,810-->1:05:41,900
他以为自己是不死之身
He thinks that he can't kill himself,

1020
1:05:41,900-->1:05:44,950
因为他信奉上帝  神神叨叨的
because he believes in God and things like that.

1021
1:05:44,960-->1:05:47,690
我觉得这对其他赛车手是很危险的
I think it is very dangerous for the other drivers.

1022
1:05:47,690-->1:05:49,130
我信仰上帝
The fact that I believe in God,

1023
1:05:49,130-->1:05:51,760
虔诚地相信主
the fact that I have faith in God,

1024
1:05:52,590-->1:05:54,740
并不是像他们认为的那样
is not to say that I am immortal.

1025
1:05:54,740-->1:05:57,000
我就是不朽之身
It does not mean that I am immune from danger,

1026
1:05:57,620-->1:05:59,300
或者我与危险无缘
as has been said.

1027
1:06:01,670-->1:06:06,690
我也和其他人一样怕受伤
I'm afraid of hurting myself just like everyone else,

1028
1:06:06,690-->1:06:08,950
尤其是驾驶F1赛车
especially driving in Formula One,

1029
1:06:09,010-->1:06:10,720
危险更是无处不在
where the threat is constant.

1030
1:06:12,490-->1:06:15,500
西班牙大奖赛
1990年9月30日

1031
1:06:26,630-->1:06:27,690
是他吗
Is that him?

1032
1:06:28,540-->1:06:29,560
是谁啊
Who is it?

1033
1:06:40,490-->1:06:45,560
当时我在维修站  练习赛被终止了
I was in the pits. The practice were stopped.

1034
1:06:46,950-->1:06:48,700
我听到大家说
I hear by different people

1035
1:06:48,700-->1:06:51,110
唐纳利出车祸了
there was an accident, was Donnelly.

1036
1:06:51,290-->1:06:54,860
似乎挺惨的  特别惨  简直是场灾难
Was bad, was too bad, was a disaster, was...

1037
1:06:54,890-->1:06:59,630
后来我决定去现场亲自看看
And I decided to go to the place, to-- to see myself.

1038
1:07:16,570-->1:07:19,420
我脑子里乱七八糟的  不过最后...
Million things went through my mind. In the end, I...

1039
1:07:20,800-->1:07:24,100
我明白我无法放弃我的激情所在
I realised I was not going to give up my passion,

1040
1:07:24,350-->1:07:29,590
即便车祸的景象还历历在目
even just having seeing what I have seen.

1041
1:07:30,500-->1:07:35,440
我必须振作起来
And I had to put myself together,

1042
1:07:35,440-->1:07:39,370
走出阴霾  走向赛车  并再跑一圈
and walk out, go to the racing car, and do it again.

1043
1:07:39,370-->1:07:42,630
甚至这次  我要做的更好
And do it again, and do it even better than before,

1044
1:07:43,100-->1:07:46,350
因为要减小车祸事件的影响
because that was the way

1045
1:07:46,360-->1:07:50,260
这是我自己的应对办法
to kind of cover that impact it had on me.

1046
1:07:50,980-->1:07:52,390
我并不准备放弃
I was just not ready to give up.

1047
1:07:52,390-->1:07:55,200
即便继续比赛让我感到害怕
As much as I was scared to continue,

1048
1:07:55,200-->1:07:58,900
我还是不会放弃我的目标和使命
I was not ready to give up my aim, my target, my objective,

1049
1:07:58,900-->1:08:01,820
我的激情  梦想及生命的意义
my passion, my dream, my life.

1050
1:08:01,820-->1:08:03,470
这是我生命的意义所在
It is my life.

1051
1:08:44,250-->1:08:48,160
埃尔顿·塞纳 以1'19.844"取得杆位

1052
1:08:48,160-->1:08:53,240
据我所知  他脱离了生命危险
As far as I hear, he is out of danger, life danger,

1053
1:08:53,440-->1:08:57,980
就这次事故来说  实属万幸
which is a lot considering the accident.

1054
1:08:58,040-->1:08:59,160
厄运既然会降临到他头上
And as it happened to him,

1055
1:08:59,160-->1:09:00,790
也会降临到我们任何人头上
it can happen to any of us.

1056
1:09:01,170-->1:09:03,530
有些事情你预料的到
There are something that you can calculate

1057
1:09:03,530-->1:09:06,620
但总会有意料之外的事情发生
but there are things which are unexpected.

1058
1:09:06,770-->1:09:09,520
那些意料之外的事是最危险的
And those unexpected things are the most dangerous ones,

1059
1:09:09,520-->1:09:11,560
就像今天发生在他身上的事
like it happened to him today.

1060
1:09:19,420-->1:09:24,460
我希望以后不要再发生这种事
I hope we don't see those things in the future.

1061
1:09:29,610-->1:09:34,480
日本大奖赛
1990年10月21日

1062
1:09:34,490-->1:09:37,370
太惊人了  这是连续第三年
Amazingly, for the third time in a row,

1063
1:09:37,380-->1:09:40,620
日本大奖赛将决定总冠军的归属
the championship hinged on the race in Japan.

1064
1:09:42,290-->1:09:43,380
但这次
But this time

1065
1:09:43,380-->1:09:47,120
若普罗斯特退赛  冠军将是埃尔顿
if Prost didn't finish, Ayrton would be champion.

1066
1:09:48,440-->1:09:51,190
早上好  先生们
Gentlemen, morning.

1067
1:09:51,500-->1:09:57,500
本次比赛全程共五十三圈
Number of laps from green light to chequered flag will be 53 laps.

1068
1:09:57,940-->1:10:01,160
车手的任何危险举动或意图
Dangerous behaviour and/or dangerous manoeuvres

1069
1:10:01,170-->1:10:03,520
都将立即接受调查
will be immediately investigated,

1070
1:10:03,520-->1:10:06,060
并有可能在一次或多次F1赛事中
and may lead to suspension of the license

1071
1:10:06,060-->1:10:09,760
被吊销超级驾照
for one or more Formula One World Championship events.

1072
1:10:10,180-->1:10:11,540
有问题吗
Any questions?

1073
1:10:12,510-->1:10:17,000
去年对埃尔顿的处理恶心得像屎一样
There was a big fuck-up last year with Ayrton.

1074
1:10:17,930-->1:10:19,050
为什么要我们重复一遍
Why do we have to repeat the same thing?

1075
1:10:19,050-->1:10:20,360
最安全的做法是
The safest thing is...

1076
1:10:20,360-->1:10:21,490
如果你错过了之字弯
if you miss the chicane,

1077
1:10:21,490-->1:10:23,210
工作人员把你拦下来
the stewards stop you.

1078
1:10:25,700-->1:10:27,570
等没有车时再让你走
If no traffic, they let you go.

1079
1:10:27,570-->1:10:31,020
如果你掉头往回走
If you have to turn around and go backwards

1080
1:10:31,520-->1:10:35,550
与另一辆车相向而行  那就太危险了
against another car, that's dangerous.

1081
1:10:35,940-->1:10:36,900
好吧
Okay.

1082
1:10:38,580-->1:10:40,010
大家都是这么想的吗
Does everybody feel that way?

1083
1:10:40,010-->1:10:41,400
-是的  -是的
- Yes. - Yes.

1084
1:10:41,690-->1:10:44,460
谢谢大家  非常感谢
Thank you, thank you very much.

1085
1:10:46,700-->1:10:50,680
我受不了了  这太荒唐了
I can't stand it. I can't stand this. It's a joke.

1086
1:10:50,680-->1:10:52,380
在去年的事故后  这种讨论
After what happened last year, it's a joke,

1087
1:10:52,380-->1:10:53,770
真是荒唐至极
this situation.

1088
1:10:53,770-->1:10:55,910
刚刚也看到了  我一句话没说
You just proved here... I said nothing,

1089
1:10:55,910-->1:10:57,270
但有人说出了他的看法
and you see somebody raising the point,

1090
1:10:57,270-->1:10:59,370
如你所见  大家也都赞成他的观点
and you see everybody agreeing.

1091
1:10:59,370-->1:11:01,300
去年对我来说糟透了
And last year was really bad for me.

1092
1:11:01,780-->1:11:04,890
对不起  我在这待不下去了
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I have to leave.

1093
1:11:11,370-->1:11:14,670
紧张的气息弥漫了整个围场
The story down in the pit lane and on the grid is one of tension.

1094
1:11:14,670-->1:11:16,510
世界冠军触手可及
With the World Championship up for grabs,

1095
1:11:16,510-->1:11:19,040
每个人都是极度紧张
everyone is extremely tense.

1096
1:11:19,040-->1:11:21,940
埃尔顿·塞纳在今天的车手会议上中途离开
Ayrton Senna actually walked out of the drivers' meeting today.

1097
1:11:22,150-->1:11:23,760
他认为杆位的位置应该
He thinks that the pole position should be

1098
1:11:23,760-->1:11:26,450
在起跑线的左边  而不是右边
on the left hand side of the grid, not on the right.

1099
1:11:26,450-->1:11:28,660
通常来说  如果内侧赛道干净
Normally, if the inside was clear,

1100
1:11:28,670-->1:11:30,330
那当然是内侧好
the inside for sure is better.

1101
1:11:30,690-->1:11:32,990
但这的内侧很脏  外侧更好
Because it's dirty, the outside is better.

1102
1:11:32,990-->1:11:34,930
就像匈牙利站  或是
Like Hungary, or like...

1103
1:11:35,080-->1:11:39,220
理想线路就是车手通常采用的线路
The racing line is the line where the cars most normally drive.

1104
1:11:39,950-->1:11:42,240
那是最快的线路
It's the fastest line around the track.

1105
1:11:42,520-->1:11:47,600
杆位要在理想线路上  这点尤为重要
It's really important to have the pole position on the racing line.

1106
1:11:48,340-->1:11:50,480
如果你在另一边
If you are on the opposite side

1107
1:11:50,590-->1:11:53,810
就要跑在很少被使用线路上
you are on apart of the track that is rarely used

1108
1:11:53,810-->1:11:55,720
那抓地力会减半
and has half the grip.

1109
1:11:55,770-->1:12:00,270
如果你在干净的赛道上  起跑会更好
If you have the clean circuit, you'll get away better than the dirt side

1110
1:12:00,270-->1:12:02,220
因为在内侧根本没有抓地力
because on the inside you have no traction.

1111
1:12:03,750-->1:12:04,980
我们会查看一下的
We'll have a look.

1112
1:12:04,990-->1:12:05,990
拜托了
Please.

1113
1:12:06,260-->1:12:08,020
但大会仲裁
But would the Chief Steward,

1114
1:12:08,020-->1:12:11,650
国际汽联  或者说巴莱斯特会同意吗
would the FIA, would Balestre, agree?

1115
1:12:13,130-->1:12:14,300
明天的日本大奖赛
Ayrton Senna will be

1116
1:12:14,300-->1:12:17,950
埃尔顿·塞纳将从杆位起跑
in pole position for tomorrow's Japanese Grand Prix.

1117
1:12:18,000-->1:12:19,940
普罗斯特第二位
Prost was second fastest.

1118
1:12:36,690-->1:12:40,120
声音来自
罗恩·丹尼斯\N迈凯轮车队经理

1119
1:12:42,650-->1:12:48,120
移到了脏的一侧  他感觉这不公平
moved to the dirty side of the circuit, which he felt was unjust.

1120
1:12:49,950-->1:12:52,240
巴莱斯特促成了这一举措
That decision was influenced by Balestre.

1121
1:12:52,240-->1:12:54,390
我知道是他  我们都心知肚明
I know that, we know that.

1122
1:12:55,110-->1:12:57,420
我被制度玩了好几回
I was fucked many times by the system.

1123
1:12:57,420-->1:13:00,090
我对自己说  "今天想玩我  没门"
I told myself, "Today, there's no way."

1124
1:13:00,100-->1:13:03,080
今天  得按我的规矩来
Today has to be my way.

1125
1:13:03,080-->1:13:05,610
我不管后果如何  就得按我的规矩来
I don't care what happens, it has to be my way.

1126
1:13:13,340-->1:13:15,130
塞纳全力起跑
And Senna sprints away,

1127
1:13:15,130-->1:13:18,310
但阿兰·普罗斯特领先  果然发生了
but Alain Prost takes the lead! It's happened!

1128
1:13:21,900-->1:13:24,290
塞纳试图从内侧超车
Senna is trying to go through on the inside...

1129
1:13:29,110-->1:13:30,430
发生了碰撞
And a collision.

1130
1:13:30,540-->1:13:31,780
出车祸了
Clashed.

1131
1:13:32,890-->1:13:34,630
塞纳被撞了
Senna has been hit.

1132
1:13:34,840-->1:13:37,510
阿兰·普罗斯特和埃尔顿·塞纳再次相撞
Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna have come together again,

1133
1:13:37,520-->1:13:41,350
并且双双离开赛道  难以置信
and were both off the racetrack! This is unbelievable!

1134
1:13:41,350-->1:13:45,250
如果比赛继续  那么冠军得主就已确定
If the race continues, the title would have been assigned.

1135
1:13:45,250-->1:13:47,000
我们还不知道会不会有红旗出现
We don't know yet whether we're going to see a red flag.

1136
1:13:47,000-->1:13:48,200
目前还没出红旗
We haven't seen any yet,

1137
1:13:48,200-->1:13:50,300
看来比赛会继续进行
so it looks as if the race is going to continue.

1138
1:13:50,530-->1:13:52,460
冠军争夺战落下帷幕
The Championship is over.

1139
1:13:52,460-->1:13:56,410
埃尔顿·塞纳是1990年的世界冠军
Ayrton Senna is the world champion 1990.

1140
1:14:02,120-->1:14:07,200
以这种方式揭晓世界冠军有些失望
That's a very sad way for this year's World Championship to finish.

1141
1:14:15,320-->1:14:17,960
我绕到塔楼后面
I circled around back the tower

1142
1:14:18,720-->1:14:22,400
完全处在禁区
and were standing right in an illegal place,

1143
1:14:23,750-->1:14:25,280
在维修站的入口
at the pit entrance.

1144
1:14:25,970-->1:14:30,990
埃尔顿刚刚过线进入维修站
And soon as Ayrton cross the line into the pits,

1145
1:14:32,000-->1:14:33,470
我走到墙边
I came over the wall

1146
1:14:34,840-->1:14:36,160
耳麦中一片嘈杂
and in my ear,

1147
1:14:36,160-->1:14:38,190
电视台的人就不停地对我说
all the way back, from Bristo connected they were saying,

1148
1:14:38,190-->1:14:40,400
针对这次意外和车祸提问
"Ask him about the incident, ask him about the crash.

1149
1:14:40,400-->1:14:43,050
问问他谁对谁做了什么
Ask him about who did what to whom."

1150
1:14:44,380-->1:14:46,620
你能谈谈第一圈发生的事吗  埃尔顿
Can you tell us what happened on the first lap, Ayrton?

1151
1:14:47,280-->1:14:50,930
埃尔顿·塞纳  巴西人 1990年世界冠军

1152
1:14:51,510-->1:14:52,910
结果双双出局
and we both went off.

1153
1:14:53,120-->1:14:54,490
你认为这是由于杆位在赛道上的
Do you think that's because the pole position

1154
1:14:54,490-->1:14:57,460
位置不对造成的吗  你曾抗议过
is on the wrong side of the track here? You wanted to change that.

1155
1:14:57,740-->1:14:58,420
当然是
Absolutely.

1156
1:14:58,420-->1:15:01,500
你拼了老命去抢那个杆位
You fight, you break your... to be on pole,

1157
1:15:01,500-->1:15:03,880
而他们却把你放到了另一边
and then they put you on the wrong side of the circuit.

1158
1:15:03,890-->1:15:05,860
你夺得了世界冠军  感觉如何
How do you feel about being World Champion?

1159
1:15:06,540-->1:15:08,250
总不至于很糟糕吧  不是吗
It's not a bad feeling at all, is it?

1160
1:15:08,250-->1:15:09,590
恭喜你
Congratulations.

1161
1:15:13,300-->1:15:19,280
声音来自
罗恩·丹尼斯\N迈凯轮车队经理

1162
1:15:26,920-->1:15:29,970
他显然不为自己感到骄傲
He was certainly not proud of himself.

1163
1:15:30,050-->1:15:32,890
以这种方式分出胜负
Certainly not revelling in the fact that

1164
1:15:32,900-->1:15:36,680
他当然不会欢呼雀跃
this had determined the World Championship.

1165
1:15:38,930-->1:15:41,840
本年度F1车手总冠军是
Formula One World Championship for drivers,

1166
1:15:41,840-->1:15:43,390
埃尔顿·塞纳
Ayrton Senna.

1167
1:15:44,290-->1:15:46,730
埃尔顿·塞纳  请上台领奖
Approaching the World Champion, Ayrton Senna.

1168
1:15:53,800-->1:15:55,610
他知道我紧跟着他
He knew I was right with him.

1169
1:15:55,610-->1:15:59,060
他移到内线  要进第一个弯道
He moved to the inside line, going towards the first corner.

1170
1:15:59,060-->1:16:01,840
我当时在追他  他露出了破绽
I just chased him then, and he opened the gap.

1171
1:16:02,230-->1:16:05,540
他很了解我
And knowing me like he does know,

1172
1:16:05,700-->1:16:08,330
他肯定会意识到  如果机会出现了
he must realise that if there was a gap,

1173
1:16:08,360-->1:16:10,300
我会尽力赶超他
I was gonna try to overtake him.

1174
1:16:10,650-->1:16:14,080
好吧  我再问你一个问题
Okay. Let me ask you another difficult question.

1175
1:16:14,330-->1:16:18,410
如果我列出所有的世界冠军
If I were to count back all the world champions,

1176
1:16:18,430-->1:16:23,150
他们与其他车手的碰撞次数
the number of times they had made contact with other drivers,

1177
1:16:23,150-->1:16:26,610
跟你过去的36个或48个月内
that you in the last 36 months or 48 months

1178
1:16:26,620-->1:16:28,290
撞车次数相比
have been in contact with

1179
1:16:28,290-->1:16:32,320
你撞车的次数远大于他们的总和
more other cars and drivers than they might have done in total.

1180
1:16:33,380-->1:16:36,880
我很惊讶你会这样问  斯图尔特
I find amazing for you to make such a question, Stewart,

1181
1:16:36,880-->1:16:38,810
因为你经验丰富
because you are very experienced

1182
1:16:39,370-->1:16:40,910
并且对赛车了如指掌
and you know a lot about racing,

1183
1:16:41,940-->1:16:45,070
那你就应该知道作为一名赛车手
and you should know that by being a racing driver

1184
1:16:45,100-->1:16:47,360
身处无尽的危险之中
you are under risks all the time.

1185
1:16:47,730-->1:16:51,550
身为赛车手就意味着与其他人竞争
And by being a racing driver means you are racing with other people.

1186
1:16:51,640-->1:16:54,700
如果你不再力求进取
And if you no longer go for a gap that exists,

1187
1:16:54,700-->1:16:56,410
那你算不上一名赛车手了
you're no longer a racing driver.

1188
1:16:56,430-->1:16:59,660
因为我们要竞争  力争上游
Because we are competing. We are competing to win.

1189
1:17:00,000-->1:17:03,990
我们所有人最大的动力就是获取胜利
And the main motivation to all of us is to compete for a victory.

1190
1:17:03,990-->1:17:05,310
而不是为了获得第三
It's not to come third,

1191
1:17:05,310-->1:17:06,430
第四  第五或第六  对吧
fourth, fifth or sixth, right?

1192
1:17:06,430-->1:17:08,460
但事实情况却不总是如此吧
But hasn't that always been the case?

1193
1:17:08,460-->1:17:09,790
我认为这就是本末倒置
But I think it's all irrelevant.

1194
1:17:09,790-->1:17:11,390
杰克  你的看法
All what you're saying, Jack,

1195
1:17:11,390-->1:17:12,980
真的是本末倒置
is really irrelevant.

1196
1:17:13,400-->1:17:15,070
因为在过去的三年里
Because I'm a driver that won more races than

1197
1:17:15,070-->1:17:16,920
我赢得的比赛最多
anybody over the past three years.

1198
1:17:16,920-->1:17:18,140
我是历史上
I'm a driver that has been

1199
1:17:18,140-->1:17:20,580
赢得杆位次数最多的人
on pole position more than anybody in history.

1200
1:17:20,580-->1:17:23,810
我在过去的三年内获得两次车手总冠军
And I'm a driver that won two titles in the past three years.

1201
1:17:23,980-->1:17:25,710
我真想不明白
And I don't think how...

1202
1:17:25,710-->1:17:30,310
我无法理解你为什么想颠倒黑白
I cannot comprehend how you can try to turn things around

1203
1:17:30,310-->1:17:33,300
去强调我出的事故是最多的
to say that I've been involved in more accidents than anybody

1204
1:17:33,300-->1:17:34,930
因为这并不是事实
because that is not true as well.

1205
1:17:35,680-->1:17:38,800
埃尔顿·塞纳和普罗斯特之间的竞争
The rivalry between Ayrton Senna and Prost

1206
1:17:38,820-->1:17:41,770
是我职业生涯内在整个体坛中
is the strongest I've ever seen in sports

1207
1:17:41,770-->1:17:43,010
所见过的最激烈的竞争
throughout my career.

1208
1:17:43,010-->1:17:45,830
我投身于F1超过三十八年
Over 38 years spent in Formula One,

1209
1:17:45,920-->1:17:50,320
我也曾参与过足球赛事  世界杯  奥运会
I was involved in football, World Championships, Olympic Games

1210
1:17:50,320-->1:17:52,010
以及许多其他赛事
and worked in many other areas,

1211
1:17:52,010-->1:17:52,880
但我从未见过
but I've never seen

1212
1:17:52,880-->1:17:55,770
像普罗斯特和埃尔顿之间的这种竞争
a rivalry similar to that between Prost and Ayrton.

1213
1:17:55,770-->1:17:58,220
他什么都懂
He understood everything.

1214
1:18:01,610-->1:18:04,410
有人批评埃尔顿的为人处事
There were criticisms, especially by Prost,

1215
1:18:04,410-->1:18:07,630
尤其是自普罗斯特抱怨更多
the behaviour of Ayrton as a person.

1216
1:18:08,390-->1:18:12,320
但他是个真真正正的赛车手
But he really was a pure product of car racing,

1217
1:18:13,860-->1:18:18,260
他为F1带来了一种风格

1218
1:18:18,260-->1:18:22,260
在那之前  只是卡丁车比赛的特色
until that time, particular to kart,

1219
1:18:22,260-->1:18:29,150
他不轻言放弃  力争上游
which was a very no compromise kind of approach to racing.

1220
1:18:30,770-->1:18:32,780
敢与对手短兵相接
Head to head against your rivals,

1221
1:18:33,830-->1:18:36,430
他认为赛车之间的碰撞是正常的
physical contact between the machines was okay, was fine.

1222
1:18:36,430-->1:18:39,220
在卡丁车比赛中是足够安全的
In karts was you know, safe enough.

1223
1:18:42,210-->1:18:49,440
但这种风格放到F1上就有所不同了
But bring that into-- into cars was something quite different.

1224
1:18:49,670-->1:18:52,340
比他年长的对手会感到震惊
And I think that was one of those things

1225
1:18:52,340-->1:18:55,400
我认为这是原因之一
shocked his slightly old rivals.

1226
1:18:55,900-->1:18:59,170
他们无法适应
They weren't used to that too.

1227
1:18:59,170-->1:19:02,180
他们的成长背景不同
They grown up was different,

1228
1:19:02,290-->1:19:06,880
不能与对手发生摩擦的观念
was rooted in the belief that you didn't make contact

1229
1:19:07,040-->1:19:08,830
根深蒂固  
with another rival's car,

1230
1:19:08,830-->1:19:10,680
因为你可能因此而丧命
because if I did that you were like to die.

1231
1:19:10,820-->1:19:13,220
F1历史上最为伟大的两大神车手
Two of the greatest champions in the history of Formula One

1232
1:19:13,230-->1:19:15,250
共沉沙海  冠军毁于一旦
ended up in the sand. Championship ruined.

1233
1:19:15,250-->1:19:18,140
他们互相指责  但普罗斯特最为刻薄
They accused each other, but Prost was the hardest.

1234
1:19:18,140-->1:19:19,960
他的反应非常暴力
His reaction was violent.

1235
1:19:20,130-->1:19:23,100
我当时真想冲他脸上打一拳
I wanted to punch him in the face,

1236
1:19:23,100-->1:19:24,820
没能拿到冠军
but I was so disgusted

1237
1:19:24,820-->1:19:27,770
让我觉得很不爽
that did not succeed.

1238
1:19:28,000-->1:19:31,220
这让我很恶心
It makes me sick.

1239
1:19:31,220-->1:19:33,270
此后的几个赛季
Senna versus Prost,

1240
1:19:33,280-->1:19:35,530
塞纳和普罗斯特继续他们之间的争斗
which went on for a couple of seasons more,

1241
1:19:35,530-->1:19:38,020
是当时F1最大的看点所在
was just absolutely wonderful for Formula One's appear.

1242
1:19:38,020-->1:19:40,670
下面播放体育新闻  昔日战友反目成仇
The sports. It's the end of a love story.

1243
1:19:40,670-->1:19:44,180
电视的收视率上升  一切都热情高涨
The television ratings improved. Everything went up.

1244
1:19:44,180-->1:19:45,280
成为人们的热点话题
People talked about it.

1245
1:19:45,280-->1:19:49,040
人们争论不休  大为震惊的同时为之着迷
It was controversial, shocking, fascinating.

1246
1:19:51,300-->1:19:53,900
同时也造就了这项运动的风行
The success of the sport also breed in all

1247
1:19:53,900-->1:19:56,590
伯尼·埃克里斯通非常聪明
commercially and Bernie Ecclestone, he was clever

1248
1:19:56,590-->1:19:58,910
把握住电视转播权
in the way to distribute television.

1249
1:19:58,910-->1:20:02,410
但是要想保持收视神话  需要不断爆料
But, to keep the audience, you need the publicities

1250
1:20:02,410-->1:20:05,750
而普罗斯特和塞纳的故事最为红极一时
and of course, the Prost and Senna story was a big hit.

1251
1:20:05,750-->1:20:08,370
由于F1在电视上的影响力
Ayrton became very famous outside the sport,

1252
1:20:08,370-->1:20:11,400
埃尔顿声名远扬  甚至传到体育界之外
thanks to the impact of Formula One on TV.

1253
1:20:18,320-->1:20:21,140
我为这些人感到抱歉  因为
I feel sorry for the people because...

1254
1:20:24,950-->1:20:26,180
他们都是好人
They are nice people

1255
1:20:26,180-->1:20:29,250
看着他们被推开并不好受

1256
1:20:29,250-->1:20:30,560
我非常抱歉
I...I feel so sorry.

1257
1:20:37,230-->1:20:39,570
巴西的形势大为不同
In Brazil, it was very different.

1258
1:20:40,560-->1:20:44,130
人们对当时的统治制度非常不满
The people were unhappy under their regime that was ruling then.

1259

贫穷局势危殆

当时巴西的局势令人沮丧

1263
1:20:59,440-->1:21:06,340
但埃尔顿多次获胜之后
But many times, when Ayrton won,

1264
1:21:06,350-->1:21:09,130
没有像其他人一样试图掩饰巴西国籍
instead of trying to hide his Brazilian origins, as others did,

1265
1:21:09,130-->1:21:12,380
相反  他高高挥舞祖国的国旗
he did the opposite, waving the flag of his country.

1266
1:21:12,750-->1:21:15,660
他每周日都会把国旗放入车内
He took it inside the car every Sunday.

1267
1:21:15,660-->1:21:18,720

1:21:18,720-->1:21:20,750
因此人们非常喜爱他
That's why they loved him so much.

1269
1:21:23,960-->1:21:27,000
没有任何事情
Attending a Brazilian Grand Prix,

1270
1:21:29,460-->1:21:30,790
能和参加巴西大奖赛相比拟
there's nothing like it.

1271
1:21:31,130-->1:21:35,670
埃尔顿·塞纳也处于顶峰状态
And when Ayrton Senna is on top,

1272
1:21:36,570-->1:21:41,700
能亲身体验  进入赛场
it is just an out of body experience to be involved,

1273
1:21:42,030-->1:21:43,830
让人觉得仿佛灵魂出窍
to be in the paddock, to be on the grid.

1274
1:21:43,830-->1:21:45,110
人们问我
People ask me,

1275
1:21:46,150-->1:21:48,260
"十五年的F1赛场生涯中
"What was your greatest experience

1276
1:21:48,260-->1:21:50,340
你最为难忘的经历是哪一次"

1277
1:21:50,340-->1:21:53,350
他们对我的回答感到吃惊
And they're amazed that I say,

1278
1:21:54,040-->1:21:57,200
我的回答是  "比赛第一次回到圣保罗
"The first time that the race-back went back to Sao Paulo,

1279
1:21:57,340-->1:21:58,640
回到英特拉格斯赛道"
to Interlagos."

1280
1:21:59,730-->1:22:01,960
塞纳处于杆位
Senna is on pole position

1281
1:22:02,860-->1:22:05,280
他的车开动后
He started to race

1282

场内的三十万巴西车迷
and there're 300,000 Brazilian fans at that circuit

1283
1:22:10,120-->1:22:10,760
齐声同唱

1284
1:22:10,760-->1:22:15,280
冲  冲  冲  塞纳  塞纳

1285
1:22:16,310-->1:22:17,430
引擎发动时
When the engine started,

1286
1:22:17,430-->1:22:22,250
你无法听见近在身旁的引擎声
you could not hear the engines right next to you

1287
1:22:22,250-->1:22:25,590
因为车迷们
for the sound of the fans

1288
1:22:26,060-->1:22:30,160
不断为他歌唱祈祷
singing his prays, singing with love

1289
1:22:30,350-->1:22:31,900
表达对他的伟大成就

1290
1:22:31,900-->1:22:33,760
和他这个人的热爱

1291
1:22:34,130-->1:22:38,080
他很想赢得巴西大奖赛
He wanted to win the Brazilian Grand Prix.

1292
1:22:38,170-->1:22:41,110
他想赢得自己的大奖赛
He wanted to win his own Grand Prix,

1293
1:22:41,110-->1:22:45,180
而这一次  职业生涯七年之际
and here it is, seven years into his career,

1294
1:22:45,260-->1:22:50,040
他还没赢得对他而言最有意义的比赛
and he has not won the most meaningful race.

1295
1:22:53,250-->1:22:58,290
1991年

1296
1:22:59,460-->1:23:06,140
声音来自
雷吉纳尔多·列明\N巴西环球电视评论员

1297
1:23:06,140-->1:23:08,100
埃尔顿从未赢得巴西大奖赛
Since he entered Formula One

1298
1:23:08,660-->1:23:10,160
他一直梦想着能在自己的祖国夺冠
he always dreamed of winning in his home country.

1299
1:23:12,970-->1:23:16,750
巴西大奖赛
1991年3月21日

1300
1:23:18,750-->1:23:20,490
起步很好
A good start.

1301
1:23:20,490-->1:23:21,250
加油  塞纳
Come on, Senna!

1302
1:23:21,250-->1:23:22,350
塞纳占据有利形势
Senna is in command.

1303
1:23:22,350-->1:23:24,250
54/67

1304
1:23:35,050-->1:23:37,440
埃尔顿领先
Ayrton pulled out the lead.

1305
1:23:37,440-->1:23:42,490
所处的位置让他轻而易举就能赢得比赛
He was there really, faced with a very easy nice win.

1306
1:23:48,500-->1:23:50,450
塞纳来了  开始下雨了
Here's Senna. It's starting to rain.

1307
1:23:50,450-->1:23:51,660
下雨了  它必须停

1308
1:23:54,540-->1:23:56,990
然后变速箱卡住了
And then the gearbox jamed

1309
1:23:56,990-->1:24:00,720
他还剩下几圈
and he was faced with several laps to go

1310
1:24:00,800-->1:24:03,160
只能挂在六档
only having the sixth gear.

1311
1:24:05,580-->1:24:07,440
剩下七圈
7 Laps Remaining

1312
1:24:07,440-->1:24:10,250
驾驶卡在六档的F1赛车似乎是不可能的任务
It seems impossible to drive a Formula One car stuck in sixth gear.

1313
1:24:10,280-->1:24:15,110
埃尔顿想要停下来  他无法再驾驶

但他已经努力了多次

1:24:16,680-->1:24:19,450
不想前功尽弃
many times to win the Brazilian Grand Prix

1316
1:24:19,550-->1:24:22,930
体内迸发了独特的力量

1317
1:24:32,680-->1:24:35,640

夺冠

他夺冠后便晕了过去

如果撞上轮胎
You happen to hit the tires.

1412
1:32:50,120-->1:32:53,090
很有可能你会被抛向空中
It's very likely to throw you up into the air,

1413
1:32:53,090-->1:32:54,860
最后不停地翻滚
and you end up rolling and rolling.

1414
1:32:55,130-->1:32:57,160
我在墨西哥的遭遇就是这样
That's what happened with me in Mexico,

1415
1:32:57,560-->1:33:00,470
这在其他选手身上也发生过
and that has happened here with other people.

1416
1:33:00,560-->1:33:03,710
我想这不是我们此时
I agree that for the moment

1417
1:33:03,890-->1:33:07,470
能解决的问题
it's not the ideal thing that we can cover.

1418
1:33:07,480-->1:33:11,590
主席昨天已和莫斯利先生说过
The President has talked yesterday with Mr. Mosley.

1419

不  不  不  别管莫斯利先生
No, no, no. Forget Mr. Mosley.

1420
1:33:15,080-->1:33:18,420
-他已经...  -别管他

1421
1:33:18,420-->1:33:20,570

我们来讨论塞纳先生提出的问题

1424
1:33:28,270-->1:33:32,260
我们今天能为比赛做什么
what we do today for the race.

1425
1:33:32,310-->1:33:34,550
这场比赛  我们无能为力
For the race, we can not do anything.

1426
1:33:34,550-->1:33:37,420
我认为最好不要把那些轮胎放在那儿
I think it is better to not have those tires out.

1427
1:33:37,420-->1:33:41,560
昨天我碰巧在第一个之字弯错过了刹车点
I happened to lose the braking point at the first chicane yesterday.

1428
1:33:41,560-->1:33:45,080

-我直冲过去  路被挡住了  -我知道
- I went straight. It was blocked. - I know that.

1430
1:33:48,880-->1:33:50,280
我没法调头
and I could not turn back.

1431
1:33:50,280-->1:33:55,500
如果我们移走轮胎  就必须换上锥形路障
If we move the tires,we must place the cones.

1432
1:33:55,500-->1:33:58,570
可以  那样的话  就有缓冲区域

不  不
No, no.

1435

你必须从相同的地方重新发车

1436
1:34:05,760-->1:34:09,110
因为你必须顾及到赛道长度
Because you must respect the distance of the race.

1437
1:34:10,530-->1:34:11,480
对不起  但这就是规定
I'm sorry, but this is the regulation.

这是最好的决定  让·马利

我的决定才是最好的决定

1449
1:34:55,010-->1:34:56,640
我对此保持怀疑
I have a feeling for that.

1450
1:34:56,640-->1:35:00,130
不  因为你不知道我的决定是什么
No, because you don't know what's my decision.

1451
1:35:01,000-->1:35:04,370
我的决定  每次  都是最好的
Is the best, at every time,my decision.

1452

我的决定是
And my decision is

1453

进行民主投票  只有赛车手可以投票
a democratic vote. Only the drivers.

1454
1:35:10,460-->1:35:11,840
举手表决
By hands.

1455
1:35:17,370-->1:35:24,600
谁赞成将轮胎更换为锥形路障

举手

马上开工

1461
1:35:37,870-->1:35:41,220
由你换下轮胎  可以吗
You replace the tires by the cones, ok?

1462
1:35:42,930-->1:35:46,580
三小时以后

1463
1:35:50,160-->1:35:52,190
阿兰  弯道上发生了什么事
Alain, what happened at the chicane?

1464
1:35:53,280-->1:35:56,950
我试图超过塞纳
I tried to overtake Senna. It was ...

1465
1:35:57,530-->1:36:01,650
他整场比赛都在阻挡我  不太好
blocked me through the race, not very correct.

1466
1:36:02,930-->1:36:04,850
我觉得普罗斯特已经臭名远扬了
I think everyone knows Prost by now.

1467
1:36:04,850-->1:36:08,240
他总是在抱怨  不是抱怨车子  轮胎
He always complain either, by the car or tires,

1468
1:36:08,240-->1:36:13,250
抱怨团队  技师  燃油或赛道上其他选手
the team, mechanics, fuel, the other drivers of the circuit.

1469
1:36:13,260-->1:36:15,940
一切都是别人的错  他永远觉得自己是对的
Always somebody else to be blame, never his fault.

1470
1:36:15,940-->1:36:16,710
好的  没问题
Yes, no problem.

1471
1:36:16,710-->1:36:20,870
我没什么放不下的  反正我得不了冠军
But I have nothing to lose. I can't win the championship,

1472
1:36:20,890-->1:36:24,030
但如果我再在赛道上看到他阻挡我
but if I find him again at the same way,

1473
1:36:24,030-->1:36:26,750
再这么做的话  我会把他的车挤出赛道
do this correctly the same way. I will push him out.

1474
1:36:29,190-->1:36:33,770
普罗斯特被法拉利解雇  因为他批评赛车
Prost was sacked from Ferrari because he criticised the car.

1475
1:36:34,390-->1:36:37,380
他目前所能做的就是休假一年
Anything that he could do  was taking a year off,

1476
1:36:37,380-->1:36:39,410
跟所有人说他去休假
telling everyone he was on sabbatical.

1477
1:36:42,980-->1:36:47,770
大奖赛中  我最喜欢是发车的时刻
My favourite part of a Grand Prix was the starting grid

1478
1:36:48,500-->1:36:51,880
我以前常会从维修站走出来  
and I used to do the pit walk to,

1479
1:36:51,880-->1:36:53,810
走到起跑线的中央
walk down the centre of the grid

1480
1:36:53,810-->1:36:57,920
报道起跑线上各支队伍的最新动态
and give an updates on every team that was on the grid.

1481
1:36:58,610-->1:37:01,540
我不知道是不是因为
I do not know if it was because

1482
1:37:01,870-->1:37:03,720
其他人相比  我更接近起跑线
I was getting closer to the front of the grid

1483
1:37:03,720-->1:37:05,460
或者离发车位置更近
or closer to the start of the race

1484
1:37:06,080-->1:37:09,510
但我发誓  事实是
but I swear to you, as a fact,

1485
1:37:09,720-->1:37:13,240
当我站在埃尔顿·塞纳的赛车旁边
when I stood next to Ayrton Senna' s car.

1486
1:37:13,600-->1:37:18,490
就会有一股战栗的感觉
at the certain times , the hair will stand up on my arms.

1487
1:37:19,060-->1:37:22,890
那里有一股能量  一股力量
There was an energy, there was a force,

1488
1:37:23,090-->1:37:25,550
一股精神
There was a spirit in that cockpit.

1489
1:37:25,550-->1:37:31,980
那感觉是你在其他赛车手身上感受不到的
that you could not find there around any other cars on the grid.

1490
1:37:32,210-->1:37:35,440
让人为之振奋
It was absolutely electrifying.

1491
1:37:38,970-->1:37:42,900
日本大奖赛 1991年10月19日

1492
1:37:53,660-->1:37:56,890
如果我拿了第二  那比赛就结束了
If I finish in second place, The championship will be over.

1493
1:37:56,960-->1:37:59,000
如果曼塞尔输了

1494
1:37:59,200-->1:38:02,920
毫无疑问  比赛也就结束了
Then, it's almost certain that the championship will be over as well.

1495
1:38:24,960-->1:38:26,070
9/53

1496
1:38:26,070-->1:38:28,480
曼塞尔试图超越  他径直冲了出去

1497
1:38:28,500-->1:38:30,860
曼塞尔径直冲了出去

比赛结束了  曼塞尔出不来了
The Championship is over. Mansell can not leave.

巴西选手埃尔顿·塞纳  三冠王

我跟着塞纳  和他一起散步  
I followed the Senna, walked with him

1514

我们一起在许多国家的街道上散过步

1515
1:39:52,310-->1:39:57,170
特别是到了像日本这样的赛道
especially to get to the circuits, as in Japan,

1516
1:39:57,170-->1:40:01,590
旅馆距离赛道一公里远
where there is one kilometre from the hotel

1517
1:40:01,590-->1:40:05,760
路上会路过游乐园
to the track and cross an amusement park.

1518
1:40:05,760-->1:40:12,450
我常想  怎么会有人如此受到热爱
And I thought: "How can a person be adored so much? "

1519

可以说是到了无比崇拜的地步

我亲吻了塞纳  
I kissed his hand next to the Senna,

他是巴西唯一的优点

三次问鼎之后  我见到的塞纳与之前判若两人

他是如此的满足  充满自信

他对赛车这项运动了如指掌

你今天有谈到F1吗

1534

F1太规矩了  今天可是狂欢节
Formula One is too rigid. Today is Carnival.

1535

你女友是否曾对你说过"再快点  埃尔顿"

埃尔顿  三个总冠军
Ayrton for the third world title

1538
1:41:45,330-->1:41:47,700
这是他在开始F1赛车前
was the culmination of a script he had written for himself

1539
1:41:47,700-->1:41:50,610
就为自己定下的计划
well before entering Formula One,

1540
1:41:50,650-->1:41:54,560
因为他知道自己能做到  并且能做得更好
because he knew he can do it and can do even more.

1541
1:41:54,870-->1:41:58,240
他早已是巴西的体育明星
He was already an idol of sport in Brazil.

1542
1:41:59,090-->1:42:00,720
在取得了三个总冠军之后  
With the third title,

1543
1:42:00,720-->1:42:03,090
他成为了世界明星

我有一股不断完善自我的冲劲

每当我感觉自己学习的步伐慢下来

1547
1:42:22,650-->1:42:26,100
遇到瓶颈期时
my learning curve is getting flatten or whatever.

1548
1:42:26,430-->1:42:28,220
我就会感到很郁闷
Then it doesn't make me very happy.

1549
1:42:30,360-->1:42:33,240
不仅是作为一名专业赛车手进步
And that a pride not only the professional,

1550
1:42:33,240-->1:42:35,160
也是作为一个人

当然
Of course.

1552
1:42:39,980-->1:42:41,270
和成为赛车手相比  
I shall have a lot more to learn as a man

1553
1:42:41,270-->1:42:43,320
我在做人方面  还有很多要学习
than a racing driver.

1554
1:42:43,320-->1:42:47,910
因为我的职业生涯不可能持续很多年
because my career couldn't last for not many years.

1555
1:42:48,270-->1:42:51,750
但愿  我能活的更长久一些  
My life, hopefully, would go for a long time.

1556
1:42:52,620-->1:42:56,140
或许我现在只走过了人生的一半
Maybe I'm only half of my life right now.

1557
1:42:56,140-->1:43:02,110
生命中依然还有很多事要做  
So there is a lot to go, a lot to learn,

1558
1:43:02,110-->1:43:04,220
很多东西要学
and a lot to do still in life.

1559
1:43:05,070-->1:43:07,660
当我真正完善自己的时候  
And the happiness will come,

1560
1:43:07,660-->1:43:09,860
真正的快乐就会油然而生
when I feel complete as a whole.

1561
1:43:10,250-->1:43:12,380
那种快乐与我今日的快乐不可同日而语
which differently I don't feel today.

1562
1:43:13,060-->1:43:16,110
不过  我还有大把的时间去获得这种快乐
But I have plenty of time to fulfil that, too.

1563
1:43:20,850-->1:43:25,210
1992年

1564
1:43:28,380-->1:43:30,200
下一赛季  
For the next season,

1565
1:43:30,200-->1:43:32,330
比赛完全被颠覆
the level of the competition was distorted

1566
1:43:32,330-->1:43:36,390
一切归因于威廉姆斯车队使用的新技术
by what was going on technics with the Williams cars.

1567
1:43:38,580-->1:43:40,710
赛车能够自动调节平衡
The car balanced itself.

1568
1:43:41,020-->1:43:43,410
每个拐弯处都由电脑操控
Each corner was controlled by computer.

1569
1:43:45,820-->1:43:47,140
赛车手所要做的就是
What the drivers have to do is

1570
1:43:47,140-->1:43:49,770
把他的右脚踩在油门上  不断加速
put his right foot down and go as fast as possible.

1571
1:43:50,070-->1:43:52,680
因此  对于一辆无法自我平衡的赛车  
So in a car without that,

1572
1:43:52,680-->1:43:54,050
这无疑是个很大的弱势
it was at serious disadvantage.

1573
1:43:54,360-->1:43:57,920
迈凯轮完全无法和威廉姆斯-雷诺比拼
McLaren is still well off the Williams-Renault's place

1574
1:43:57,920-->1:44:01,670
三届世界冠军埃尔顿·塞纳
with the result, that the three times world champion Ayrton Senna

1575
1:44:01,670-->1:44:04,480
不可能继续蝉联冠军
has no chance in retaining his title.

1576
1:44:06,150-->1:44:09,650
当你卷入这股
When you enter into this sort of

1577
1:44:11,780-->1:44:13,820
电子技术战
electronic war

1578
1:44:16,670-->1:44:21,580
你会发现自己完全处于进退两难的境地
you can find yourself completely stuck.

1579
1:44:21,770-->1:44:26,630
电子技术战的形势逼人
Electronics do a given situation.

1580
1:44:26,850-->1:44:32,210
奈杰尔·曼塞尔  1992年世界冠军

1581
1:44:33,450-->1:44:35,930
我认为这并非大家所期望的
I do not think it really what you want.

1582
1:44:36,260-->1:44:40,190
大家想要的是一名真正的
to have a throughly World Championship

1583
1:44:42,160-->1:44:43,120
车手总冠军
of drivers.

1584
1:44:43,120-->1:44:44,740
谈判很漫长
The negotiations were lengthy

1585
1:44:44,740-->1:44:47,460
谁将会成为普罗斯特的队友  仍不得而知
and still do not know who will be Prost's team-mate.

1586
1:44:47,470-->1:44:49,240
三届世界冠军已经和威廉姆斯车队
The three-time world champion has signed

1587
1:44:49,240-->1:44:51,100
签订了一份长达两年的合约
a two-year contract with Williams

1588
1:44:51,100-->1:44:54,350
本周即将开始测试
and during the week begin to test the car.

1589
1:44:56,760-->1:45:14,660
阿兰·普罗斯特

1590
1:45:15,390-->1:45:18,460
当我九月份在埃什托里尔比赛时  
I realised that

1591
1:45:18,460-->1:45:20,000
我就意识到了这点
when I drove the car in September, in Estoril

1592
1:45:20,020-->1:45:22,850
前几圈  路面很湿
and the first few laps, it was wet

1593
1:45:23,000-->1:45:25,400
车子的性能简直是太棒了
and the car was absolutely unbelievable.

1594
1:45:25,400-->1:45:29,200
职业生涯中  我从未如此酣畅淋漓开过车
I have never driven a car like this in my career.

1595
1:45:29,200-->1:45:32,540
不过  那是真正的赛车
But, yeah. It was a native car

1596
1:45:32,540-->1:45:37,090
时机恰到好处  车子性能也很棒
the time was good, a good second minimum a good second quicker

1597
1:45:37,090-->1:45:39,470
我在争取和威廉姆斯车队签约
It's not a secret that I've been

1598
1:45:40,240-->1:45:43,040
这已经不是
trying very hard to get some

1599
1:45:45,900-->1:45:47,620
什么秘密了
some deals with Williams.

1600
1:45:49,320-->1:45:52,310
情况非常复杂
Situation is very complex.

1601
1:45:52,440-->1:45:58,560
情况不大好  也不明了
It is not nice. It's not clear, either.

1602
1:46:04,670-->1:46:06,960
有一件事  我确信无疑
I'm pretty sure of one thing:

1603
1:46:08,200-->1:46:11,660
如果我停赛一两年
I'm the one that has more to lose

1604
1:46:12,870-->1:46:15,560
我的损失比任何人都要惨
if I had to stop for a year or more,

1605
1:46:15,560-->1:46:19,420
因为我站在了职业生涯的顶峰
because I am at the peak of his career

1606
1:46:19,830-->1:46:25,410
F1赛车手的职业生涯是有限的
and the career of a Formula One driver is limited.

1607
1:46:27,370-->1:46:32,060
如果停赛  我的损失将比任何人都惨重
So if I stop, I'd lose out more than anyone else,

1608
1:46:32,100-->1:46:35,840
不管是在职业  还是在个人方面都是如此
at both professionally and personally.

1609
1:46:35,840-->1:46:42,900
阿德里亚娜·盖里斯图
塞纳的女友

1610
1:46:43,370-->1:46:48,890
1993年

1611
1:46:51,470-->1:46:55,730
1993年埃尔顿驾着他的赛车  如有神助
In 1993, Ayrton steered his car so brilliant.

1612
1:46:55,860-->1:46:58,280
在我看来  那是他表现最好的一个赛季
For me, it was his best season.

1613
1:46:59,330-->1:47:01,350
欧洲大奖赛  1993年

1614
1:47:03,600-->1:47:05,170
摩纳哥大奖赛  1993年

1615
1:47:05,170-->1:47:07,500
虽然大多时候
even though he spent most of his time

1616
1:47:07,500-->1:47:09,430
他都落后于威廉姆斯车队
looking at the back of Williams,

1617
1:47:09,440-->1:47:11,600
他们的车比他的快多了
which is much faster than his.

1618
1:47:13,230-->1:47:14,980
法国车手阿兰·普罗斯特 
The French driver Alain Prost

1619
1:47:14,980-->1:47:18,540
第四次赢得了F1大奖赛车手总冠军
has won the World Drivers Championship Formula One for the fourth time

1620
1:47:18,540-->1:47:21,170
普罗斯特获得了冠军  准备退役了
Prost won the championship and duely retired,

1621
1:47:22,280-->1:47:24,440
从此退出了历史舞台
thus getting out of the way.

1622
1:47:25,690-->1:47:29,350
看起来你与迈凯轮即将告别
It seems like a little goodbye from you to McLaren.

1623
1:47:29,350-->1:47:32,730
你觉得这会是你在迈凯轮的最后一个赛季吗
Do you think it was your last season at McLaren?

1624
1:47:32,860-->1:47:35,720
我想是的  这将会是我的最后一个赛季
I think so. I think it to be my last season.

1625
1:47:35,720-->1:47:37,200
我有一份三年的合约
I have a three-year contract.

1626
1:47:37,680-->1:47:41,380
七月的时候
Then I have a moment where in July

1627
1:47:41,760-->1:47:46,070
我接到了弗兰克的电话  他跟我说
I have a phone call from Frank, and tells me:

1628
1:47:46,070-->1:47:50,450
我们得谈谈  雷诺方面给了我很大的压力
"I need to talk. I have a big pressure from Renault

1629
1:47:52,740-->1:47:54,580
我要和你谈谈
"And I need to talk to you about something."

1630
1:47:54,810-->1:47:56,120
我说  好了  弗兰克
I said, OK Frank.

1631
1:47:56,700-->1:48:00,370
我想我知道你要和我谈什么
I think I know what you want to talk about.

1632
1:48:00,580-->1:48:06,310
但是  我现在在休假  我要休息四五天
"But I'm on my holiday." I have four or five days on my holiday.

1633
1:48:06,470-->1:48:08,710
如果雷诺方面有话要和我谈
"If Renault's people want to talk to me,

1634
1:48:09,360-->1:48:10,670
让他们来见我
they come to see me

1635
1:48:11,310-->1:48:15,040
实际上他自己来找我了  带着这个计划
In fact he comes himself, with this plan,

1636
1:48:15,040-->1:48:18,300
跟我解释说
came to see me and tried to explain to me that

1637
1:48:19,690-->1:48:25,730
雷诺想把埃尔顿招致麾下
Renault are thinking of having Ayrton in the team

1638
1:48:25,730-->1:48:28,010
明年和我搭档
with me the year after

1639
1:48:28,960-->1:48:34,320
我说  这么做不对  我们是有合同的
I said, "OK, it is not fair. We have a contract.

1640
1:48:34,320-->1:48:35,760
在赛季之中
Even thinking about that is not fair

1641
1:48:35,760-->1:48:38,660
有这种想法都是不应该的
in the middle of the season.

1642
1:48:39,180-->1:48:42,250
先把这事放放  等等看
So let's put in this way, let's wait a little bit,

1643
1:48:42,800-->1:48:46,700
再等几场比赛  看会发生什么
a few races, and we see what happens. "

1644
1:48:47,920-->1:48:49,640
实际上  我下面要跟你说的
And in fact I'm going to tell you something

1645
1:48:49,640-->1:48:53,460
没人知道  或者只有极少数人知道
that nobody knows, or very few people know,

1646
1:48:53,460-->1:48:56,190
但现在说这些也未尝不可
but that's good to talk about that in this...

1647
1:48:56,630-->1:48:58,020
我当时不想
I did not want to...

1648
1:48:58,020-->1:49:00,710
我不想再和埃尔顿做队友了
I don't want to be a teammate with Ayrton again.

1649
1:49:01,780-->1:49:09,110
我不想让人们觉得
I did not want to continue with this perception of the people say

1650
1:49:09,110-->1:49:13,050
埃尔顿就是开着破车的小可怜
"OK, Ayrton is the poor guy with his small car and

1651
1:49:13,440-->1:49:15,600
阿兰呢  他要是赢了  很正常
Alain is... when he wins, it's normal,

1652
1:49:15,600-->1:49:17,880
因为他的车好嘛
because he has the best car. "

1653
1:49:18,430-->1:49:21,390
我就说  我明白你们想要埃尔顿
I said: "OK, you want Ayrton in and I understand very well.

1654
1:49:21,390-->1:49:22,490
但是你们得按合同
But you pay me

1655
1:49:22,490-->1:49:26,150
支付我明年的年薪  我就退役
the contract next year and I will stop. "

1656
1:49:26,210-->1:49:27,700
我不想退役
I did not want to stop.

1657
1:49:27,910-->1:49:29,420
我真的不想退役
I really did not want to stop.

1658
1:49:29,420-->1:49:33,960
但是看到事态又一次发展成了这样
But to see the situation going again,

1659
1:49:33,960-->1:49:36,860
特别是在你自己的国家
especially in your own country,

1660
1:49:38,840-->1:49:40,420
又一次重蹈覆辙
going in this direction again,

1661
1:49:41,370-->1:49:44,720
我很快就下定了决心
I took the decision myself very quickly.

1662
1:49:44,920-->1:49:48,090
但我打算过一两个月再告诉他们
But I wanted to tell them just one month or two months,

1663
1:49:48,090-->1:49:49,850
因为我想拿这个世界冠军
because I wanted to be world champion.

1664
1:49:49,850-->1:49:51,350
我不想失去这个机会
I did not want to lose this opportunity.

1665
1:49:51,350-->1:49:54,540
在我确认自己可以拿到冠军奖杯的时候
When I saw that I was going to be world champion,

1666
1:49:54,540-->1:49:56,150
我说  好吧  你们付钱  我退役
I said, "OK, you pay the contract I stop.

1667
1:49:56,150-->1:49:57,790
我受够了
I've had enough. OK? "

1668
1:49:57,790-->1:49:59,800
这就是我当时的作为  我不想退役
That's what I've done. I did not want to stop.

1669
1:49:59,800-->1:50:02,260
我退出F1就是因为这个原因
I stopped Formula One only because of that.

1670
1:50:02,260-->1:50:04,190
不然的话我还会继续的
Otherwise I wanted to continued.

1671
1:50:04,880-->1:50:07,580
埃尔顿在摩纳哥站奋尽全力
Ayrton fought hard to win at Monaco,

1672
1:50:07,590-->1:50:08,640
但还是没能夺冠
but did not make it,

1673
1:50:09,370-->1:50:14,010
想拿下铃鹿站  也没能成功
Tried to win at Suzuka, but did not make it,

1674
1:50:14,090-->1:50:18,300
当他终于进入了威廉姆斯车队
and when he struggled to go to Williams

1675
1:50:18,310-->1:50:21,580
却已经接近他生涯的终点
was the end of his career.

1676
1:50:21,580-->1:50:25,810
有时这一切都是徒劳  我们总是说
Sometimes it makes no sense ... We always say

1677
1:50:25,940-->1:50:27,770
要为理想而奋斗
that we must fight for our ideals,

1678
1:50:27,770-->1:50:30,650
为生命的意义而奋斗
for what we want out of life.

1679
1:50:30,650-->1:50:36,440
但有时风雨过后  看到的却不都是彩虹
But sometimes the battles do not bring the desired results.

1680
1:50:38,970-->1:50:44,530
1993年  澳大利亚大奖赛决赛

1681
1:50:44,530-->1:50:48,260
咱们都要尽全力
Let's try doing the best we can.

1682
1:50:48,260-->1:50:49,320
当然
Of course.

1683
1:50:49,900-->1:50:54,500
把别的事情都放到一边
OK, we'll put behind this what has happened.

1684
1:50:55,720-->1:50:56,680
当然
Sure.

1685
1:50:58,440-->1:51:01,230
就算我们得好好谈谈  也不是今天
Even if we got to say anything,

1686
1:51:01,230-->1:51:02,970
今天有今天的事情
that was my goal in there.

1687
1:51:03,130-->1:51:03,860
好  我明白
Okay, I know it.

1688
1:51:03,860-->1:51:06,200
就算我不跟你谈  即使什么也谈不成
If I'm not talking to you, if we didn't talk at all,

1689
1:51:06,350-->1:51:11,730
我也不会改变  这是我一直奋斗的目标
I wouldn't change ... that's I always tried.

1690
1:51:20,790-->1:51:22,100
你钻出赛车的时候
What did Ron Dennis say to you

1691
1:51:22,100-->1:51:23,680
罗恩·丹尼斯跟你说了些什么
when you step out from the car?

1692
1:51:23,940-->1:51:26,430
他说  现在改主意还不晚
It's never too late to change your mind.

1693
1:51:29,580-->1:51:33,300
他说他为我高兴  而且...
But anyway, he said he was happy for me and...

1694
1:51:33,300-->1:51:35,610
他跟我也是这么说的
That's what he told me, too.

1695
1:51:36,550-->1:51:37,650
罗恩就是这样
That's Ron.

1696
1:51:40,670-->1:51:43,080
我说  咱们必须记住这些美好的时光
And I said you know, we must keep the good times,

1697
1:51:43,080-->1:51:45,770
这些美好的片段  就此结束
the good moments, and let's finish that way.

1698
1:51:45,890-->1:51:48,470
以美好的回忆结束
Finish with the good things.

1699
1:51:56,880-->1:52:01,070
这是塞纳为迈凯轮车队效力的最后一站
It was Senna's last race for McLaren,

1700
1:52:02,170-->1:52:04,530
也是普罗斯特为威廉姆斯效力的最后一站
Prost's last race for Williams.

1701
1:52:05,810-->1:52:07,830
当时没有人会想到
and although nobody knew,

1702
1:52:07,900-->1:52:09,590
那是他们两人
that it was the last time

1703
1:52:09,600-->1:52:12,710
最后一次登上领奖台
either of them would be on the podium.

1704
1:52:13,370-->1:52:21,960
1993年  澳大利亚大奖赛

1705
1:52:39,200-->1:52:43,050
但从这一刻  从我站在领奖台上
But from this moment, when I am on the podium

1706
1:52:43,050-->1:52:45,120
站在他旁边的亚军位置上开始
close to him on the sub level,

1707
1:52:45,810-->1:52:49,690
他完全改变了
he has changed completely.

1708
1:52:49,740-->1:52:51,610
变成了另一个人
He was really another person,

1709
1:52:51,610-->1:52:56,820
这天之前和这天之后  完全不同
it was before this podium and after this podium.

1710
1:52:56,820-->1:52:59,020
让我无法相信
It's absolutely unbelievable,

1711
1:52:59,020-->1:53:01,260
在我看来
it was a different person,

1712
1:53:02,240-->1:53:04,430
就是另一个人  另一个车手
a different driver, in my opinion,

1713
1:53:05,660-->1:53:07,300
完全不同的性格
and a different personality.

1714
1:53:07,990-->1:53:10,200
从各方面来看  他和以前完全不同
He just behaved completely different.

1715
1:53:10,550-->1:53:11,940
在记者招待会上
At the press conference,

1716
1:53:14,650-->1:53:18,320
很有幸当时有很多记者到场
it was lucky, that we had all the TV waiting for us,

1717
1:53:18,320-->1:53:21,650
但他一直在讲  不停的讲
but he was talking and speaking

1718
1:53:21,650-->1:53:23,870
不停的问我问题
and asking questions to me all the time,

1719
1:53:24,180-->1:53:27,910
就像我们以前从没说过话一样
talking as he had never talked before.

1720
1:53:28,650-->1:53:32,450
离开莲花投奔迈凯轮是对的
It was certainly right go to McLaren after the Lotus.

1721
1:53:32,460-->1:53:34,510
绝对是个明智的选择
It was absolutely the right choice.

1722
1:53:36,030-->1:53:41,100
和阿兰·普罗斯特竞争
And to compete himself against Alain Prost

1723
1:53:42,540-->1:53:46,460
是一件非常勇敢和大胆的事情
was a very brave and very shrew thing to do.

1724
1:53:46,470-->1:53:49,670
因为他知道  或者说是坚信
Shrew because he knew, or he believed,

1725
1:53:49,670-->1:53:51,200
他比普罗斯特更强
that he was better than Prost

1726
1:53:51,200-->1:53:53,450
通过跟F1当年的标志性人物
and, by measuring him against the man

1727
1:53:53,450-->1:53:57,600
进行面对面的较量
who was accepted as the arts of Formula One at the time,

1728
1:53:58,140-->1:54:04,550
他就能向世人证明自己的实力
he could prove for good and all his own quality.

1729
1:54:04,570-->1:54:07,820
他发现  有一支车队
So he could see that that there was another team

1730
1:54:07,820-->1:54:11,080
比迈凯轮更强
that had a better car than McLaren,

1731
1:54:11,080-->1:54:14,310
拥有九十年代初最好的赛车
and the best car by mile in the early 90s.

1732
1:54:14,310-->1:54:18,560
92年  他们帮助奈杰尔·曼塞尔夺冠
You know, in the 92 they won World championship with Nigel Mansell

1733
1:54:18,560-->1:54:20,870
93年帮助普罗斯特夺冠
and in '93 they won with Prost.

1734
1:54:21,490-->1:54:24,980
他希望在94年  坐在车里的人是自己
And he wanted to be in the that car for '94.

1735
1:54:25,540-->1:54:29,780
就是这时  他的直觉背弃了他
and that was when his instincts let him down.

1736
1:54:29,950-->1:54:35,370
或许  就客观因素和种种数据而言
Probably, given the known factors and given the parameters,

1737
1:54:35,370-->1:54:36,900
这个决定没错
it was the right decision.

1738
1:54:37,110-->1:54:40,350
即使回到那个年代  面对当时的情况
and you would go back and look at the conditions

1739
1:54:41,200-->1:54:43,950
你也会做出同样的决定
and make exact the right decision.

1740
1:54:44,650-->1:54:48,130
但事实证明  这是个错误的决定
Exactly that decision, it happened to be the wrong one.

1741
1:54:48,940-->1:54:51,340
但在当时  他不可能预见未来
But there was no way he could have known that,

1742
1:54:51,610-->1:54:53,140
直到他在94年
until he actually stepped

1743
1:54:53,140-->1:54:57,270
坐进了威廉姆斯的赛车
into the Williams car for the first time in '94.

1744
1:54:57,280-->1:55:01,230
威廉姆斯车手发布会

1745
1:55:06,200-->1:55:10,330
埃尔顿一直都是最好的车手
Ayrton is always the best driver available,

1746
1:55:10,470-->1:55:12,490
是一辆车能遇到的最好的车手

1747
1:55:12,570-->1:55:14,090
弗兰克·威廉姆斯

1748
1:55:15,790-->1:55:17,210
所有的合作伙伴
and all partners,

1749
1:55:17,210-->1:55:20,450
投资商和赞助商都期待我们夺冠
investors and sponsors expect that of us.

1750
1:55:20,450-->1:55:23,690
不管多好的设备
and that is there for the best piece of equipment,

1751
1:55:23,690-->1:55:24,750
只要你想要
if you like,

1752
1:55:24,750-->1:55:28,670
我们都能安装到赛车上  满足要求
we can put it in that machine, to deliver to our requirement.

1753
1:55:28,670-->1:55:31,110
国际汽联宣布
The International Motor Sport Federation has banned

1754
1:55:31,110-->1:55:34,120
禁止在F1赛车上使用有争议的
some of the  controversial computer devices

1755
1:55:34,120-->1:55:37,200
车手辅助电子设备
which help drivers in Formula One motor racing.

1756
1:55:37,200-->1:55:38,930
这项禁令意在打破诸如
The ban is designed to stop domaination

1757
1:55:38,930-->1:55:40,910
威廉姆斯-雷诺等大车队
 of the richest Formula One teams,

1758
1:55:40,910-->1:55:44,110
对赛事的垄断
like the Williams-Renault, the world champions.

1759
1:55:44,490-->1:55:46,090
1994年

1760
1:55:46,830-->1:55:48,830
对埃尔顿·塞纳来说
To Ayrton Senna,

1761
1:55:48,830-->1:55:50,290
唯一的对手就是时间
is a race against time.

1762
1:55:50,290-->1:55:54,230
目前的问题是团队的磨合和对新车的适应
Must be an integral team and adapt to the new car.

1763
1:55:54,970-->1:55:57,050
他说  这并不容易
He says they are not at ease.

1764
1:55:57,050-->1:55:59,730
今年的赛车不再有电子辅助系统
The car is no longer electronic components used last year:

1765
1:55:59,730-->1:56:00,720
牵引力控制
traction control

1766
1:56:00,720-->1:56:04,350
特殊刹车系统和动态悬架系统
special brakes and active suspension.

1767
1:56:04,350-->1:56:09,770
没有了动态悬架系统
The cars are much less stable

1768
1:56:10,430-->1:56:12,570
赛车的稳定性大大降低
without the electronically controlled suspension.

1769
1:56:14,530-->1:56:18,000
驾驶赛车将更困难
As a result, are more difficult to drive

1770
1:56:18,230-->1:56:23,770
更容易出现脱离赛道甚至撞车的现象
and it is very likely to occur more coats and off the track.

1771
1:56:24,560-->1:56:27,700
更多的撞车  对观众来说更有看点
More coats mean more fun for the audience

1772
1:56:27,700-->1:56:31,670
对我们来说  安全完成比赛是第一位的
and also for us, until the pilot nothing happens.

1773
1:56:31,770-->1:56:35,030
不然的话  这可不是一件好事
Otherwise, it is not a good situation.

1774
1:56:36,130-->1:56:39,390
巴西大奖赛
1994年3月27日

1775
1:56:39,950-->1:56:42,450
被第一名落下将近八秒钟
almost eight seconds between them now

1776
1:56:44,530-->1:56:48,540
56/71

1777
1:57:00,780-->1:57:04,940
威廉姆斯车队首席工程师  派翠克·哈德

1778
1:57:04,940-->1:57:08,460
我们当然不开心
things Ayrton in the car at that moment,

1779
1:57:08,530-->1:57:11,370
操控不是很好
the handling isn't particular good.

1780
1:57:12,650-->1:57:16,210
太平洋大奖赛
1994年4月17日

1781
1:57:16,210-->1:57:18,920
去年安装在赛车上的电子辅助装置
The cars weren't supposed to have any of the electronic aids

1782
1:57:18,920-->1:57:21,490
今年被禁止使用
installed the previous year.

1783
1:57:21,490-->1:57:23,640
可塞纳却坚信
But Senna became convinced

1784
1:57:23,640-->1:57:26,570
赛季前两站均获胜的
that the Benetton beed driven by Michael Schumacher

1785
1:57:26,660-->1:57:28,790
贝纳通车队车手迈克尔·舒马赫
who have won the first two races of the season

1786
1:57:28,790-->1:57:33,220
在赛车上保留了一些
have retain some of those particularly the traction control,

1787
1:57:33,410-->1:57:36,000
防止赛车打滑的牵引力控制系统
the thing that eliminated wheelspin.

1788
1:57:39,350-->1:57:48,950
声音来自
弗兰克·威廉姆斯\N威廉姆斯车队经理

1789
1:57:51,930-->1:58:04,670
伊莫拉赛道  圣马力诺大奖赛
1994年4月

1790
1:58:09,550-->1:58:14,540
如果他带着个人情绪参加了那场比赛
If he carried any emotion going to that race,

1791
1:58:15,110-->1:58:18,920
那肯定和之前的比赛不一样
that was different from previous races,

1792
1:58:18,920-->1:58:22,370
或许是因为
it would probably be the frustration

1793
1:58:22,750-->1:58:28,110
知道他的竞争对手的赛车上
to know that his principle rival is driving a car

1794
1:58:28,120-->1:58:31,950
安装了违禁设备而感到沮丧
with a illegal system on it.

1795
1:58:33,970-->1:58:39,910
对手无视公平竞赛的做法激怒了他
And that would always incense his sense of fair play.

1796
1:58:42,200-->1:58:43,720
我认为
I would put anything,

1797
1:58:44,440-->1:58:46,980
他的任何异常举动
anything that was abnormal on his behaviour,

1798
1:58:46,980-->1:58:49,070
都是由这一点引起的
just down to that knowledge and believe.

1799
1:58:49,930-->1:58:51,960
我必须说  这是他当时说的
I must say what he said,

1800
1:58:51,960-->1:58:53,990
因为我自己也没法确定
because I can not judge myself

1801
1:58:53,990-->1:58:58,510
但他当时确信  贝纳通在作弊
but he was convinced Benetton was cheating.

1802
1:58:58,660-->1:59:04,930
这个问题使得他非常失落  非常困扰
He was very upset and he was in big trouble because of that.

1803
1:59:05,260-->1:59:08,570
又一次  他开始抱怨赛车
and again not pretty happy with the car,

1804
1:59:08,570-->1:59:11,050
抱怨赛车的表现
 with the performance of the car.

1805
1:59:11,460-->1:59:16,480
很显然  他很不开心
So, he was obvious not happy,

1806
1:59:17,850-->1:59:20,450
他说他已经失去了动力
saying that he could not find the motivation.

1807
1:59:20,450-->1:59:21,860
他对我说过很多次
Many times he told me:

1808
1:59:21,860-->1:59:24,310
我不想再跟迈克尔比下去了
"I can not be motivated against Michael,

1809
1:59:24,530-->1:59:27,280
不想跟任何人比了
against all other drivers."

1810
1:59:27,620-->1:59:30,850
就像
It was really like

1811
1:59:32,190-->1:59:34,950
他失去了激情一样
if he had lost his passion,

1812
1:59:35,730-->1:59:38,690
对赛车不满意  对车队不满意
he had problems with the car, problem with the team,

1813
1:59:39,340-->1:59:43,790
安全问题  或许是一些个人问题
safety, maybe some small personal problems, possible.

1814
1:59:43,790-->1:59:47,260
但他丧失了他的车技
But he had lost his skill.

1815
1:59:48,250-->1:59:50,220
非常出乎意料
That was very surprising.

1816
1:59:50,490-->1:59:52,800
在我看来  很显然
It was very apparent to me,

1817
1:59:52,800-->1:59:57,410
包括埃尔顿身边的几个人
and to several other people around Ayrton.

1818
1:59:59,320-->2:00:03,470
他的教练  也是最好的朋友  约瑟夫
Josef, his trainer and probably one of his closest friends,

1819
2:00:03,470-->2:00:04,820
席德·沃特金斯
Sid Watkins,

1820
2:00:06,230-->2:00:09,350
我们三个人  由于不同的原因
all three for this, for different reasons,

1821
2:00:09,350-->2:00:11,510
很快达成了共识
very quickly formed an opinion

1822
2:00:11,860-->2:00:15,560
埃尔顿后悔离开了迈凯轮
that Ayrton quickly regretted leaving the team.

1823
2:00:17,640-->2:00:24,540
倒不是因为竞争的问题
Not specifically because of competitiveness or uncompetitiveness,

1824
2:00:24,540-->2:00:28,020
更像是因为
but more because he didn't

1825
2:00:28,630-->2:00:31,550
他没想到现在的车队文化
expect find himself in such a different culture

1826
2:00:32,100-->2:00:38,930
和原来的车队有那么大的差别
and one which is quite alien to the way he was.

1827
2:00:42,010-->2:00:45,740
塞纳  夺冠的责任

1828
2:00:55,010-->2:00:56,740
我们现在从零开始
We are here starting from zero.

1829
2:00:56,740-->2:00:59,390
所以也可以说  冠军之路从这里开始
so basically our championship starts here.

1830
2:00:59,390-->2:01:03,870
条件不是很好  但这就是现实
It's not the comfortable position to be in, but that's the reality.

1831
2:01:03,870-->2:01:05,750
你已经在这里赢了三次了
You've won here three times already,

1832
2:01:05,750-->2:01:08,000
你还那么想赢第四次吗
are you really do need to make it four?

1833
2:01:08,960-->2:01:10,230
我很希望
I would love to.

1834
2:01:10,880-->2:01:15,610
1994年4月29日  星期五  练习赛

1835
2:01:50,870-->2:01:52,610
那个周末塞纳太紧张了
Senna was so nervous that weekend.

1836
2:01:52,610-->2:01:56,030
我没见过他紧张成这样
I had never seen him so tense.

1837
2:02:00,560-->2:02:04,070
我没见他笑过一下
I never saw him smile even for a moment.

1838
2:02:05,520-->2:02:08,370
一直保持着精神高度集中
Always maintained a concentrated expression,

1839
2:02:08,370-->2:02:11,350
生气而又伤心的表情
irritated, sad.

1840
2:02:18,160-->2:02:20,150
是平衡的问题
It is the balance.

1841
2:02:20,240-->2:02:22,230
很不稳定
It is unstable.

1842
2:02:27,840-->2:02:30,070
车况更差了
The car has worsened.

1843
2:02:32,880-->2:02:35,470
是持续偏向一侧
is it generally more one balance than the other,

1844
2:02:35,560-->2:02:37,070
还是两侧交替
or it's changing?

1845
2:02:37,400-->2:02:39,510
转向不足更严重了
It tends to understeer more.

1846
2:02:39,600-->2:02:43,990
第一圈  转向不足
In the first lap, tended to understeer.

1847
2:02:44,600-->2:02:48,470
第二圈  突然就变了
Then, in the second lap, has changed abruptly.

1848
2:02:50,400-->2:02:52,430
转向过度和转向不足吗
Oversteer and understeer?

1849
2:02:52,560-->2:02:53,590
对的
Yes

1850
2:02:54,600-->2:02:56,510
车子不是在转弯的中线
Instead of in the mid of the corner,

1851
2:02:56,600-->2:02:58,830
而是完全偏离
it goes straight away.

1852
2:02:59,840-->2:03:02,590
当抓地力应该减小时会过了头
When it's supposed to break away, it breaks away even more.

1853
2:03:10,040-->2:03:13,670
他的车子就像是
He was getting into a car that was like a kind of,

1854
2:03:13,670-->2:03:17,300
未驯服的小马
you know, an unbroken colt if you like.

1855
2:03:18,520-->2:03:21,710
他有很多问题和缺点
He had a lot of problems, a lot of vices

1856
2:03:22,480-->2:03:25,690
需要下功夫去解决
that needed to be worked on and ironed out.

1857
2:03:25,690-->2:03:27,930
有些还是根本问题
Some of them seemed pretty fundamental.

1858
2:03:29,000-->2:03:33,030
车手最痛恨的事情
One things that the driver hates above all else

1859
2:03:33,120-->2:03:36,330
就是车子在转弯时不听话
is a car that changes its behaviour in the middle of a corner.

1860
2:03:37,160-->2:03:39,660
有两种情况  转向过度和转向不足
There are two things, oversteer and understeer.

1861
2:03:39,920-->2:03:42,380
我们以前称转向过度为四轮漂移
Oversteer is what we used to call the four-wheel drift.

1862
2:03:42,480-->2:03:45,790
当你踩着油门转向时
You know, when you steer a car with throttle

1863
2:03:46,720-->2:03:49,670
你要转方向盘来平衡
and you turn the steering wheel to balance it

1864
2:03:49,760-->2:03:52,230
就好像要驶向你实际要去的
in such a way that you appear to be going in an opposite direction

1865
2:03:52,230-->2:03:53,040
相反方向
the way you want to go.

1866
2:03:53,040-->2:03:56,230
但实际上车子滑行过了转角
But actually the car drifts around... slides around the corner.

1867
2:03:56,400-->2:03:59,940
转弯不足是指你需要比预期的
Understeer is when you have to put more steer on than you expect

1868
2:04:00,040-->2:04:01,200
转向更多才能驶过转弯处
to get around a corner.

1869
2:04:02,760-->2:04:04,470
大部分车
And the worst thing is most cars

1870
2:04:04,560-->2:04:06,550
只有其中的一样
have the character sick of one or the other

1871
2:04:06,640-->2:04:09,310
但非常差的车会两样都有
but really bad cars have both.

1872
2:04:09,400-->2:04:12,840
在转弯时
And they change from one to the other in the blink of an eye

1873
2:04:12,840-->2:04:13,830
瞬间相互变化
in the middle of a corner

1874
2:04:13,830-->2:04:16,550
在你最不希望它发生的时候
when you least wanting that to happen.

1875
2:04:16,680-->2:04:19,170
这点让车手非常不安
And that's very very disturbing for driver,

1876
2:04:19,170-->2:04:23,590
因为这会摧毁他对于车子的信心
because it destroys his faith in the integrity of the car.

1877
2:04:23,680-->2:04:28,030
而车手对于车子的特征和行为
And that's absolutely crucial to particularly Formula One,

1878
2:04:28,520-->2:04:34,830
建立起完全的信任是非常重要的
to developing, for the driver, to develop that complete trust

1879
2:04:35,080-->2:04:38,430
尤其是对于F1而言
in the car's temperament and behaviour.

1880
2:04:39,200-->2:04:41,270
在94年的赛季一开始
And it was very clear in the beginning of 94 season

1881
2:04:41,360-->2:04:43,470
威廉姆斯车队很明显缺乏这点
that Williams absolutely didn't have that.

1882
2:04:43,560-->2:04:45,670
他车子的平衡
He had this really unpleasant characters

1883
2:04:45,670-->2:04:47,430
不断地改变
to give change in its balance.

1884
2:04:49,120-->2:04:51,830
这问题需要花很大力气去解决
And that takes a lot of sorting out.

1885
2:04:52,360-->2:04:54,350
在赛季末尾  我们看到
You know, we saw, by the end of the season,

1886
2:04:54,800-->2:04:56,670
威廉姆斯确实解决了这个问题
that Williams had sorted it out.

1887
2:04:57,200-->2:05:01,230
达蒙·希尔不断赢得比赛  接近问鼎冠军
Damon Hill was winning races, challenging for the title.

1888
2:05:02,400-->2:05:05,790
而且在后面的三个赛季
And for the next season and the two seasons after that,

1889
2:05:05,880-->2:05:09,870
96和97赛季  威廉姆斯车队赢得了冠军
in '96 and '97, Williams won the title again

1890
2:05:10,920-->2:05:13,110
因为他们已经走过了那段低谷
because they had gone through that bad period.

1891
2:05:13,200-->2:05:16,030
但塞纳正好在这个时候加入
But Senna's arrival coincided with it.

1892
2:05:16,200-->2:05:21,470
我觉得那让他很是困扰
and I think that was very - that was very disturbing to him,

1893
2:05:21,560-->2:05:23,670
因为这和他的预期不符
because he'd gone there, expecting something else.

1894
2:05:23,760-->2:05:25,310
他期待的是加入后
He'd gone there expecting to be able to

1895
2:05:25,310-->2:05:27,830
能开着一辆可以赢得比赛的车
walk into a championship winning car.

1896
2:05:27,920-->2:05:31,620
而相反  他却需要认真地
Instead what he found with himself was a serious job

1897
2:05:31,720-->2:05:34,020
帮助工程师们
of helping the engineers

1898
2:05:34,920-->2:05:39,190
排除车子的问题从而使之再次具有竞争力
to purge the car of its vices and make it competitive again.

1899
2:05:44,300-->2:05:49,500
鲁本斯·巴里切罗
乔丹车队

1900
2:05:49,590-->2:05:51,110
不用  我认识
No, I already know.

1901
2:05:51,240-->2:05:53,190
是因为久仰大名还是你们以前见过
The familiar name of or you've already met?

1902
2:05:53,280-->2:05:58,760
我认识他是因为我关注F1  而且我们见过
I know him because I follow Formula One and we met.

1903
2:05:58,760-->2:06:00,610
那你怎么还这么紧张
Why are you so nervous, then?

1904
2:06:00,960-->2:06:03,550
因为站在他这样的人旁边
Because standing next to someone like him

1905
2:06:03,640-->2:06:05,470
总是让我很紧张
always put me in turmoil.

1906
2:06:05,920-->2:06:10,070
祝你接下来比赛好运
Good luck to the sample and the eventual champion.

鲁本斯·巴里切罗

1908
2:06:26,280-->2:06:27,420

你见到鲁本斯了吗
Have you seen Rubens?

1910
2:06:56,480-->2:06:58,050
他还好  他还好
He's alright. He's alright.

1911
2:06:58,050-->2:07:00,160
当然他受了些惊吓  但是他还好
He's shocked of course, but he's alright.

1912
2:07:00,720-->2:07:03,230
-你跟他说过话了吗  -说了
- Have you talked to him?  - Yes.

1913
2:07:04,640-->2:07:06,590
鲁本斯  早日康复
Get well, Rubens.

1914
2:07:10,400-->2:07:14,590
1994年4月30日  星期六

1915
2:07:16,680-->2:07:18,150
当我到伊莫拉赛道时
When I arrived at Imola

1916
2:07:18,240-->2:07:23,470
第一个看到的就是大屏幕
and the first thing I saw was the screen

1917
2:07:23,560-->2:07:29,030
上面写着  阿兰  我们想你了
where it has recorded "Alain, we miss you."

1918
2:07:29,160-->2:07:32,430
我们想念你  阿兰
"We miss you, Alain."

1919

我的朋友阿兰  我们想你了
"To my friend, Alain. We miss you."

1920

或者我想你了

我很开心

这是他为我做的最棒的事情

1923

因为这对我很重要

不止因为  很不幸地
not only because that happened, unfortunately,

2:07:57,200-->2:08:00,270
这是他死前一天的事
the day before he died.

1926
2:08:01,680-->2:08:03,430
如果你
When you are...

1927
2:08:06,360-->2:08:09,980
从一个车手的角度出发
Try to put yourself in a driver's position.

1928
2:08:10,080-->2:08:12,610
这时候你再想想  
When you do that...

1929
2:08:12,610-->2:08:17,390
为什么埃尔顿会在那时候想到我
Why Ayrton would think about myself at this time of the day.

1930
2:08:17,560-->2:08:22,470
我总是思考这个问题  真是难以置信
I always thought about that. It is unbelievable to me.

1931
2:08:22,560-->2:08:25,830
这个表达出了很强烈的信息
And this message is very strong.

1932
2:08:25,920-->2:08:30,430
而这对我一直很重要

埃尔顿那天非常沮丧而且落了泪
Ayrton was very very upset and cried that day.

1955
2:11:14,590-->2:11:16,040
我跟他说

你是世界上速度最快的人

1959
2:11:22,200-->2:11:26,850
他喜欢钓鱼  所以我说
And he liked fishing. So I said "Why don't you quit,

1960
2:11:27,800-->2:11:30,070
不如我们一起退役  然后去钓鱼
and I'll quit. And we'll just go fishing."

1961
2:11:31,800-->2:11:33,790
他说  席德  我不能退役

弗兰克·威廉姆斯完全不确定

我确定我不想比赛

在赛场上走来走去
was coming from Williams to the box, back and forth.

我总是问问他们的策略

1974

问巴西的车手或者其他附近的车手

我能在比赛中跟观众讲讲的事情
I can report to the public during the race.

1978

我以为我也能问埃尔顿些问题
I expected to be able to

1979
2:13:10,560-->2:13:13,190
但我没问成
give my question to Ayrton, but could not.

1980
2:13:13,280-->2:13:16,470
我发觉那不是个提出这种要求的好时机

于是他翻开圣经  读了一段
He opened the Bible and read a passage that said

1984
2:14:10,760-->2:14:16,580
那段说  上帝会赐予最好的礼物
that God would give the greatest gift of all,

1985
2:14:17,200-->2:14:19,730
或是上帝他自己

他带着奥地利国旗

希望能挥动这国旗向罗兰·拉岑博格致敬
wanted to wave it as a tribute to Roland Ratzenberger.

1997
2:16:29,200-->2:16:33,030
安全车车灯熄灭了

1998
2:16:33,160-->2:16:36,510
这说明安全车要驶入维修区了

声音来自
席德·沃特金斯教授\NF1赛医

2009
2:19:04,760-->2:19:09,470
通过他的神经精神体征
And I saw from his neurological signs,

2010
2:19:09,600-->2:19:12,690
我能看出这是致命的头部伤
that it was going to be a fatal head injury.

2011
2:19:21,520-->2:19:26,910
然后他叹了口气  接着身体就放松了
Then he sighed, and his body relaxed.

2012
2:19:28,120-->2:19:32,230
就在那时  虽然我不信教
And that was the moment ... I am not religious,

2013
2:19:32,320-->2:19:36,510
但我觉得就在那时他的灵魂离开了
but I thought that his spirit had departed.

2014
2:20:28,480-->2:20:31,430
看着直升机飞向医院
Seeing the helicopter going to the hospital,

2015
2:20:32,520-->2:20:35,310
我还在心存希望
I was still hoping.

2:20:36,440-->2:20:37,910
我没发觉
I did not realise...

2017
2:20:39,120-->2:20:44,270
在现场解说时我并没发觉
During the live commentary I did not realise.

我猜测他肯定是受伤严重
I imagined that he was going to be hurt

2019

2020
2:20:47,600-->2:20:50,190
但我没有意识到他去世了
but I did not realise he was dead.

2021

也许是我不想意识到这点
I did not want to realise, probably.

2022
2:20:56,640-->2:20:58,630
那是不现实的
It was unreal.

2023
2:20:59,000-->2:21:06,750
埃尔顿的事故是由他自己的车子引起的
Ayrton's accident was caused by problems of his own car.

2024
2:21:07,400-->2:21:09,700
这起事故
And, certainly where,

2025
2:21:11,680-->2:21:15,870
与他和周围其他赛车的竞赛
in no way connected to the competitiveness

2026
2:21:15,960-->2:21:18,340
绝无关联
of any of the cars around him.

2027
2:21:20,120-->2:21:24,310
总有人会说
Again there are people who would claim

2028
2:21:25,680-->2:21:32,350
贝纳通车队的迈克尔
that he was pursued of Michael in the Benetton was

2029
2:21:35,560-->2:21:40,030
追得过紧  因为他需要弥补
overly aggressively, because of his necessity to compensate

2030
2:21:40,120-->2:21:42,420
车子本身的不足
for the inadequacies of his car.

2031
2:21:43,040-->2:21:46,190
但我觉得那根本就是胡说
But again, I think that's a nonsense.

2032
2:21:47,360-->2:21:50,350
这不过是那些人想要歪曲事实
It's again, it's just people trying to rewrite the script.

2033
2:21:51,560-->2:21:53,590
单纯的事实就是
Simple fact is...

2034
2:21:53,680-->2:21:58,830
几乎可以肯定的是埃尔顿死于
Ayrton almost certainly suffered a car failure,

2035
2:22:00,040-->2:22:01,990
赛车故障引起的事故
which caused the accident,

2036
2:22:05,320-->2:22:09,870
这只是一连串发生的事中的一件
it was one of those things, these things happen.

2037
2:22:10,760-->2:22:13,390
这肯定是机械故障
It was certainly a mechanical problem.

2038
2:22:16,080-->2:22:17,830
我说话很注意
I'm very careful about what I say,

2039
2:22:17,920-->2:22:24,250
因为他们改动了驾驶杆
because they made the steering column different.

2040
2:22:26,520-->2:22:28,980
不排除这种可能
It could be a possibility.

2041
2:22:29,120-->2:22:32,510
我真的不知道
I have no idea, precisely.

2042
2:22:35,280-->2:22:37,840
但肯定是机械故障
But for sure it was a mechanical failure.

2043
2:22:38,120-->2:22:42,950
不能浪费他的天赋
The gift that he has had to be used.

2044
2:22:43,040-->2:22:48,910
上天赐予他天赋  他有责任利用他的天赋
And an obligation to whatever force or power giving him that gift,

2045
2:22:49,760-->2:22:53,540
去成就事业  实现梦想
had an obligation to pursue his career, pursue his passion.

2046
2:22:55,240-->2:22:59,950
当然  这些想法
and, of course that, those thoughts

2047
2:23:06,920-->2:23:09,350
当他去世时
there were very much with me

2048
2:23:10,280-->2:23:12,430
萦绕在我脑海中
when he lost his life,

2049
2:23:17,600-->2:23:23,550
在那时  即使大家都还不确定
because even in the moment when realised,

2050
2:23:23,640-->2:23:27,550
但还是能意识到
when nobody knew for sure, but even in the moments

2051
2:23:27,640-->2:23:29,750
他真的去世了
he did lost his life,

2052
2:23:31,200-->2:23:38,310
我明白这一切都是无可避免的
I found myself strangely uncomfortable with the fact

2053
2:23:41,160-->2:23:44,830
这让我感到很不舒服
they would not have done anything different.

2054
2:23:50,520-->2:23:52,150
这是他的选择
It was what he wanted to do.

2055
2:23:57,160-->2:24:00,990
如果这是他职业生涯的
And if that was the outcome

2056
2:24:07,680-->2:24:10,910
最终归宿
linked to his career,

2057
2:24:12,280-->2:24:15,430
就算他知道  我也不觉得他会做什么改变
I do not think it would change, even if he had known it.

2058
2:24:15,680-->2:24:17,290
比赛结束时
We found that this was

2059
2:24:17,290-->2:24:19,380
我们发现事情很严重
a serious just at the end of race.

2060
2:24:19,480-->2:24:23,020
即使你得到了一些不同的消息
or even you always have some different messages.

2061
2:24:23,160-->2:24:28,310
我记得那时有人报导
I remember that we had someone people come into the commentary,

2062
2:24:28,400-->2:24:32,950
说他手臂受伤了而已
and said he had broken arm. And that's it.

2063
2:24:33,360-->2:24:37,950
大概五分钟后  我们得知了噩耗
Maybe five minutes later we had very bad news.

2064
2:24:38,560-->2:24:42,790
我说在得知事实真相前
I remember saying it was no point to say

2065
2:24:42,880-->2:24:47,310
发表声明是没有意义的
unless we knew exactly what has happened.

2066
2:24:47,400-->2:24:49,900
而我们也确实从报导中得知了消息
And we did know during the commentary.

2067
2:24:50,640-->2:24:53,830
随之而来的是大量的谣言
Then we had big rumours as always.

2068
2:24:53,920-->2:24:57,390
在去机场的路上
And on the way to the airport,

2069
2:24:57,480-->2:25:01,910
我们意识到事态的严重性
we understood it was very bad.

2070
2:25:02,720-->2:25:05,280
赛后你去见弗兰克了吗
You went to Frank after the race?

2071
2:25:05,360-->2:25:08,590
没有  我去了  抱歉
No. Actually, yes, sorry.

2072
2:25:08,760-->2:25:13,670
我赛后就去停车房找弗兰克
I went to see Frank in the garage just after the race.

2073
2:25:13,760-->2:25:16,830
是实况报导结束后我做的第一件事
It was the first thing I did after the commentary.

2074
2:25:16,920-->2:25:18,600
弗兰克和派翠克在一起
Frank and Patrick were together,

2075
2:25:18,600-->2:25:22,070
但当时他们还不知道发生了什么
but still did not know.

2076
2:25:22,160-->2:25:24,060
那时比赛刚刚结束
That was just after the race.

2077
2:25:24,060-->2:25:26,070
他们一无所知
They didn't know exactly what happenned.

2078
2:25:26,520-->2:25:27,990
他们很震惊
They were shocked,

2079
2:25:28,080-->2:25:33,200
但拒绝发表意见并默默等待
but again they didn't want to make any speculations.

2080
2:25:33,280-->2:25:36,550
我们只知道  在去机场的路上
We only knew from the track to the airport,

2081
2:25:36,550-->2:25:40,790
事情越来越严重
the seriousness of the thing was increased.

2082
2:25:41,280-->2:25:45,950
回想生命中的困难  极端情绪
Reflect on the difficult things in your life, extreme emotions,

2083
2:25:48,440-->2:25:53,270
无可避免的事情并没有好转
inevitably things do not get better,

2084
2:25:53,360-->2:26:00,270
我更加伤心难过
through thought, indeed, the pain is rising for me,

2085
2:26:04,280-->2:26:10,790
在我去巴西参加他葬礼时
my emotions then were small fractions that I had

2086
2:26:11,720-->2:26:14,630
我心都碎了
when I went to Brazil for his funeral.

2087
2:26:16,720-->2:26:18,830
在巴西人民心中
For all those people in Brazil,

2088
2:26:19,960-->2:26:22,630
对世界各地的粉丝而言
for all his fans around the world,

2089
2:26:24,440-->2:26:26,630
他会永远年轻
he will always be young.

2090
2:26:35,680-->2:26:38,470
埃尔顿·塞纳永远是那么快
Ayrton Senna will always be fast.

2091
2:26:39,240-->2:26:40,950
他不会老去
He'll never be old.

2092
2:26:41,720-->2:26:47,350
对于巴西乃至全世界而言
He will always be the champion

2093
2:26:48,520-->2:26:50,950
他永远是冠军
for Brazil and the world.

2094
2:26:56,880-->2:27:00,270
即使今时今日  这份悲痛
The grief, even today,

2095
2:27:00,360-->2:27:05,380
也许是我对他的作为做出的最伟大的阐述
maybe the greatest statement I can make about what he did.

2096
2:27:06,840-->2:27:09,140
当我遇见一个巴西人时
When I meet a Brazilian

2097
2:27:10,520-->2:27:13,190
当我说出我认识埃尔顿·塞纳
soon after that I have to say

2098
2:27:15,280-->2:27:19,990
并采访过他一百多次后
I knew Ayrton Senna and I interviewed him over 100 times.

2099
2:27:21,880-->2:27:24,710
我和我妻子  和33名巴西人
I was on a cruise in the Nile river

2100
2:27:24,800-->2:27:29,030
同在尼罗河的一艘游轮上
with 33 Brazilians on this cruise with my wife and I,

2101
2:27:29,840-->2:27:31,070
我对其中一个说
and I told one of them that

2102
2:27:31,070-->2:27:34,590
我采访过埃尔顿·塞纳一百多次
I interviewed Ayrton Senna 100 times.

2103
2:27:34,720-->2:27:36,750
接下来的一周里
Sometime during the next week,

2104
2:27:36,840-->2:27:40,790
每个巴西人都跑来找我
everyone of those Brazilians had to come to me.

2105
2:27:40,880-->2:27:43,060
他们要和与埃尔顿·塞纳
They had to talk to someone

2106
2:27:43,060-->2:27:45,070
说过话的人交谈
who had talked to Ayrton Senna.

2107
2:27:45,200-->2:27:48,470
甚至是接触与埃尔顿·塞纳
Even had to touch someone who had touched

2108
2:27:48,560-->2:27:51,020
握过手的人
who had shaken hands with Ayrton Senna.

2109
2:27:51,120-->2:27:54,900
就好像我认识的是上帝
It was like I had known, and talk to,

2110
2:27:55,000-->2:27:58,110
和我交谈  握手的那个人是神一般
touched and shaken hands with God

2111
2:27:59,120-->2:28:02,110
他们通过我  也做触碰到了神
and they had to do the same through me.

2112
2:28:02,200-->2:28:04,430
当埃尔顿赢得桂冠时
These people were about 8 or 10 years old

2113
2:28:04,560-->2:28:06,940
这些人只是8岁10岁大的孩子
when Ayrton won his championships.

2114
2:28:07,520-->2:28:09,590
作为孩子  他们被教导
And as children they were taught

2115
2:28:09,680-->2:28:13,380
这个男人是最优秀的
that this was one of the greatest man lived,

2116
2:28:13,520-->2:28:16,110
巴西人
with a Brazilian passport.

2117
2:28:17,240-->2:28:20,750
当你为这项运动付出15年时
When you dedicate fifteen years to this sport,

2118
2:28:23,120-->2:28:27,070
你会想这么做是否明智
you wonder did you spend those years wisely.

2119
2:28:30,480-->2:28:31,540
我觉得很明智
I think I did.

2120
2:28:31,540-->2:28:33,710
我了解埃尔顿·塞纳
And I know Ayrton Senna...

2121
2:28:44,240-->2:28:48,270
我相信他也是这么认为的
And I know that Ayrton Senna though he had.

2122
2:28:49,600-->2:28:54,310
你能想象吗  我很想看到
Can you imagine? I would love to see

2123
2:28:54,440-->2:28:59,790
埃尔顿带着他的子孙们在海滩上玩耍
Ayrton with children and grandchildren on the beach.

2124
2:29:02,560-->2:29:05,950
但你能想象
But you can imagine to hear a news report:

2125
2:29:06,160-->2:29:08,570
听到这么一则新闻报导吗
"Ayrton Senna dying of cancer

2126
2:29:08,570-->2:29:10,550
塞纳与癌症斗争多年后去世  享年50岁
after a long battle at the age of 50? "

2127
2:29:10,640-->2:29:14,470
我不知道  从某种浪漫而不公平的角度
I do not know. In some poetic,

2128
2:29:16,360-->2:29:19,430
在赛车中结束生命
unjust way, it was almost fitting

2129
2:29:20,600-->2:29:22,670
对他来说比较好
that he died in a race car.

2130
2:29:39,660-->2:29:41,940
即使速度很快  你也不该在
Even in a racing speed, Tamburello is not a corner

2131
2:29:41,940-->2:29:43,350
塔姆布雷罗弯道发生意外
that you would make a mistake on.

2132
2:29:44,480-->2:29:46,800
那车肯定哪里出了问题
Something on that car would have to go wrong.

2133
2:29:50,640-->2:29:52,750
可能是动力转向装置出了问题
Maybe the power steering failed.

2134
2:29:53,000-->2:29:55,430
也可能是轮胎温度过高
Maybe it was the tire temperatures that

2135
2:29:55,520-->2:29:58,150
导致赛车冲出了赛道
made the car skate straight off the road.

2136
2:29:58,720-->2:30:00,490
永远无从得知真相
It will always be a mystery.

2137
2:30:02,180-->2:30:04,210
有人提起诉讼
There was a lawsuit.

2138
2:30:04,890-->2:30:09,750
在我看来  驾驶杆失灵
In my opinion, broke the steering column

2139
2:30:10,000-->2:30:11,870
会导致赛车失去控制
and the car became uncontrollable.

2140
2:30:12,400-->2:30:16,150
但毕竟  这是起事故
But above all, it was a fatality,

2141
2:30:16,240-->2:30:22,270
因为赛车撞上围栏的角度
because the car crashed with an angle for the suspension

2142
2:30:22,360-->2:30:24,030
正好使悬挂装置击中他的头盔
went to hit his helmet.

2143
2:30:26,680-->2:30:28,150
埃尔顿不走运
Ayrton ran out of luck.

2144
2:30:30,040-->2:30:33,090
他没有骨折
He did not have a broken bone in his body.

2145
2:30:33,090-->2:30:34,980
也没有任何瘀伤
He did not have any bruising.

2146
2:30:36,880-->2:30:39,110
如果那一部分碎片
If that piece of assembly

2147
2:30:39,200-->2:30:42,630
撞击部位高6英寸或低6英寸
would have gone 6 inch higher or 6 inch lower,

2148
2:30:42,760-->2:30:44,800
他就能活下来了
he would have walked back to the paddock.

2149
2:31:03,400-->2:31:05,780
意大利  博洛尼亚市

2150
2:31:13,520-->2:31:15,430
我很幸运的
I was lucky to arrive

2151
2:31:17,160-->2:31:20,990
比他的飞机早到机场半小时
at airport half an hour before his plane arrived.

2152
2:31:21,080-->2:31:26,710
我看见灵柩被抬到消防车上
I saw the coffin put onto a fire engine,

2153
2:31:27,520-->2:31:32,830
从机场出发前往市里
and taken on the road into the city from the airport,

2154
2:31:33,880-->2:31:38,030
在一条六车道还是八车道的公路上
on a six-or eight-lane highway

2155
2:31:38,200-->2:31:40,830
所有的车辆都跟着消防车
where all the traffic was going in one direction,

2156
2:31:40,920-->2:31:43,150
向着同一个方向前进
following the fire engine.

2157
2:31:43,280-->2:31:45,580
各种你想的到的车辆
Vehicles of every kind you could possibly imaginable.

2158
2:31:45,720-->2:31:48,070
太惊人了
It was just extraordinary.

2159
2:31:48,960-->2:31:52,470
全都跟着他  挂着旗帜  拉着横幅
All followed him, many with flags, banners

2160
2:31:52,560-->2:31:57,580
在各种你想的到的车的门上
or portraits taped onto sides of cars, trucks

2161
2:31:57,680-->2:32:01,150
贴着海报
or every kind of vehicle you could imange,

2162
2:32:01,960-->2:32:05,740
在去市里的高速公路上
on this high speed road into the city,

2163
2:32:05,920-->2:32:12,750
沿路的房子窗口挤满了人
passed houses and windows filled with people,

2164
2:32:12,840-->2:32:15,910
挂着旗子横幅的公寓
apartment with flags, banners

2165
2:32:16,000-->2:32:18,670
天桥上也站满了人
overbridges crowded with people,

2166
2:32:20,880-->2:32:24,070
大家都来向他致敬
all came to salute him.

2167
2:32:25,760-->2:32:29,670
人们排队来悼念他
Then people queueing to pay homage to the body,

2168
2:32:29,760-->2:32:32,830
排七八个小时的队
people queueing for seven or eight hours.

2169
2:32:32,920-->2:32:36,030
儿童  老人  形形色色的人们
Children, old people, every kind of person,

2170
2:32:38,480-->2:32:40,150
大部分是年轻人
with a predominance of young people

2171
2:32:40,240-->2:32:43,590
人口统计显示巴西是个年轻的国家
because Brazil is a young country demographically,

2172
2:32:44,480-->2:32:46,250
而且年轻人和他
And young people seemed to

2173
2:32:47,630-->2:32:50,790
似乎有种特殊的联系
have a special relationship with him.

2174
2:32:51,280-->2:32:54,190
但也有老年人  各种各样的人
But old people as well, all kinds of people.

2175
2:32:54,280-->2:32:57,220
排几个小时的队
Queueing for hours, hours and hours

2176
2:32:57,220-->2:32:58,950
就为了瞻仰遗容
just to go pass the body

2177
